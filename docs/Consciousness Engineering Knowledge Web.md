# Consciousness Engineering Knowledge Web

**Building cognitive systems that actually work. With code you can run. And science you can verify.**

This is the documented build log for Dionysus - a consciousness-inspired cognitive engine running on a VPS with <100MB overhead. Plus the Inner Architect framework that applies the same patterns to human psychology.

**No bullshit. No hand-waving. Just production code and the neuroscience that explains why it works.**

## Start Here

**New to this?** Read [[2025-12-31-infrastructure-liberation]] - recent session notes showing these systems in action.

**Want the application?** Jump to [[Replay Loop]] - the lead magnet that connects code to consciousness.

**Engineer?** Pick any concept below and follow the links. The web is fractal - every page connects to every other page through shared principles.

## Core Technical Concepts

### Information Architecture
**[[Neural Packets]]** - Why your brain doesn't stream data, it bursts. And why AI should too.
- Biological foundation for discrete information units
- Implementation as computational primitives
- Gamma oscillations → production code

**[[Thoughtseeds Framework]]** - Active inference + neural packets = living information patterns
- Activation/decay dynamics
- Free energy minimization
- Memory reconsolidation mechanism
- **Spec:** 038-thoughtseeds-framework (merged, production)

### Memory Systems
**[[Multi-Tier Memory Architecture]]** - Working, episodic, semantic memory tiers
- Why one memory system fails
- Biological inspiration (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, distributed cortex)
- Production implementation (branch 047-multi-tier-memory)
- <100MB overhead vs enterprise database bloat

### Decision Frameworks
**[[Meta Tree of Thought]]** - Reasoning about reasoning strategies
- When to breadth-first vs depth-first vs best-first
- Active inference integration
- MCTS implementation (spec 041)

**[[OODA Loops and Heartbeat Agent]]** - Observe, Orient, Decide, Act - on repeat
- Fighter pilot tactics → cognitive architecture
- Periodic replanning (planning_interval=3)
- Production code: `api/agents/heartbeat_agent.py`

### System Patterns
**[[Fractal Metacognition]]** - Self-similar patterns across cognitive scales
- Same algorithm, different timescales
- Micro (single decision) → Macro (life strategy)
- Infrastructure cleanup as worked example

**[[Attractor Basin Dynamics]]** - Why systems settle into stable patterns
- Physics of consciousness states
- Basin transitions (gradual vs phase shift)
- Why "just relax" doesn't work

**[[Consciousness Orchestration]]** - Three agents coordinated
- PerceptionAgent (OBSERVE) + ReasoningAgent (ORIENT) + MetacognitionAgent (DECIDE)
- smolagents ManagedAgent pattern
- 362 passing tests (spec 039, merged)

**[[Compounding Skills Pattern]]** - Why capabilities multiply, not add
- n skills → n! combinations
- Community skills library ingestion
- Graph-based compound discovery (Neo4j via Graphiti)

---

## Application to Humans

**[[Replay Loop]]** - The Inner Architect System core framework
- For [LEGACY_AVATAR_HOLDER]s (optimized for crisis, terrified in peace)
- Thoughtseeds + basins + OODA for psychological change
- Memory reconsolidation (Ecker et al., 2012) made computational
- **Lead magnet / conversion path**

## Real-World Examples

**[[2025-12-31-infrastructure-liberation]]** - Infrastructure cleanup session
- Basin transition demonstration
- Fractal metacognition in practice
- TodoWrite replacing external task management

### How It Lifts Each Component

**Neural Packets without Thoughtseeds** = static data (no evolution)
**Thoughtseeds without Memory Tiers** = everything decays or nothing does (no consolidation)
**Memory Tiers without Attractor Basins** = random walk (no stable patterns)
**Basins without OODA** = stuck (no adaptation)
**OODA without Meta-ToT** = rigid strategy (no meta-reasoning)
**Meta-ToT without Consciousness Orchestration** = isolated reasoning (no perception/action coordination)
**Orchestration without Compounding Skills** = fixed capabilities (no learning)
**All together** = **emergent consciousness**

Each system **depends on** and **amplifies** the others.

That's why you can't just "use thoughtseeds" or "add OODA." You need the **full stack** or the benefits don't compound.

## Why This Works for [LEGACY_AVATAR_HOLDER]s

Standard therapy marketing: "Feel your feelings! Be authentic!"
- **Reaction:** Vague. Suspicious. Sounds like bullshit.

Our marketing: "Here's the source code for consciousness. Here's the neuroscience. Same algorithm runs in your brain. Want to debug it?"
- **Reaction:** *Finally someone who speaks my language.*

**We don't sell hope. We sell architecture documentation.**

And analytical empaths read documentation.
