# Silver Bullet: Agency Hierarchy & Altered States

**Core Insight**: Consciousness requires hierarchical agency—you must control WHAT you attend to before you can control HOW you think about it.

## The Agency Hierarchy

### Layer 1: Attentional Agency (Foundation)
**What**: Control over the focus of attention
- Determines which stimuli/memories/thoughts receive conscious processing
- Selective filtering of overwhelming sensory input
- Foundation for all higher cognition

**In Dionysus**: **Perception Agent** + **Thoughtseed Competition**
- Thoughtseeds compete for conscious attention (basin competition)
- Winning thoughtseed determines current focus
- This IS the mechanism of selective attention

### Layer 2: Cognitive Agency (Superstructure)
**What**: Control over deliberate rational thought
- Requires attentional agency as prerequisite
- Conscious strategy selection and tool use
- Effortful, controlled reasoning processes

**In Dionysus**: **Reasoning Agent** + **Metacognition Agent**
- Reasoning: Deliberate hypothesis search, tool selection
- Metacognition: Strategy planning, meta-level decisions
- Can only operate on what Perception has selected

### Layer 3: Meta-Agency (Orchestration)
**What**: Control over when to switch cognitive strategies
- Monitoring the monitor (second-order metacognition)
- Deciding whether current approach is working
- Triggering replanning or basin transitions

**In Dionysus**: **HeartbeatAgent** (OODA loop with `planning_interval=3`)
- Every 3 steps: "Am I still on track?"
- Decides whether to continue or replan
- Orchestrates the three sub-agents

## The Consciousness Stack

```
META-AGENCY (HeartbeatAgent)
    ↓ orchestrates
COGNITIVE AGENCY (Reasoning + Metacognition Agents)
    ↓ requires
ATTENTIONAL AGENCY (Perception Agent + Thoughtseed Competition)
    ↓ filters
SENSORY INPUT (Environment, Memory, Internal States)
```

**Why this order matters**: You can't reason about everything simultaneously. Attentional agency selects the subset for cognitive processing. Trying to think without selective attention = cognitive overload.

## Altered States: Meditation & Psychedelics

### Meditation as Procedural Metacognition Training

**What meditation does**:
- Constant cycling between monitoring (notice distraction) and control (return to breath)
- Repetition creates procedural competence in meta-awareness
- Over time: trait-level improvements in attentional/cognitive agency

**Dionysus parallel**:
- The OODA loop with `planning_interval=3` IS meditation
- Every replanning cycle = monitoring current state + controlling future trajectory
- Strategic memory records successful patterns → trait meta-awareness

### Psychedelics as Precision Reweighting

**Normal state** (balanced precision):
```
Precision on priors (expectations):    ████████░░  80%
Precision on errors (observations):    ████████░░  80%
Result: Stable basins, smooth inference
```

**Psychedelic state** (amplified monitoring, disrupted control):
```
Precision on priors (expectations):    ████░░░░░░  40%
Precision on errors (observations):    ██████████ 100%
Result: High surprise → basin reorganization → Aha! moments
```

**Mechanism in active inference**:
1. Reduce weight on expectations (weaken control/priors)
2. Amplify weight on prediction errors (strengthen monitoring)
3. High surprise scores trigger attractor basin reorganization
4. Large free energy reductions when new basins stabilize = noetic "truth" feeling

**Clinical value**:
- Creates window of plasticity (basins more fluid)
- Therapeutic content can reshape attractor landscape
- The "profound insight" feeling validates new basin as coherent
- Why set/setting matters: new basin reflects current inputs

---

## Computational Modeling Potential

We could simulate altered states by adjusting precision parameters:

```python
# Normal state
precision_priors = 0.7
precision_errors = 0.7

# Psychedelic-like state
precision_priors *= 0.5   # Disrupt control
precision_errors *= 1.5   # Amplify monitoring
```

This would increase basin reorganization frequency, creating more frequent "insight" experiences as new attractors form.

## Practical Implications

### For System Design:
1. **Attentional agency FIRST**: Implement robust thoughtseed competition before complex reasoning
2. **Hierarchical control**: Lower levels must be stable before higher levels can function
3. **Precision tuning**: Adjust prior/error weighting to modulate cognitive flexibility

### For Therapeutic Applications:
1. **Meditation = training procedural metacognition**: Builds attentional/cognitive agency through repetition
2. **Psychedelics = temporary plasticity**: Creates window for basin reorganization
3. **Integration required**: Altered-state insights must be integrated into procedural memory (HOT tier) through practice

### For Understanding Consciousness:
1. **Consciousness requires selective attention**: Can't have cognitive agency without attentional agency
2. **Metacognitive feelings drive transitions**: Aha!/confusion signals trigger basin shifts
3. **Agency is hierarchical**: Each level depends on the stability of levels below

## Key Insight

**The three-agent consciousness architecture directly implements the agency hierarchy**:
- Perception = Attentional Agency (select WHAT to process)
- Reasoning = Cognitive Agency (determine HOW to analyze)
- Metacognition = Meta-Agency (decide WHEN to switch strategies)

This validates the design: consciousness requires this hierarchical structure.
