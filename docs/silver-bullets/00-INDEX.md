## 🧠 Meta Note

This index itself demonstrates metacognition:
- **Declarative**: You know these concepts exist (index listings)
- **Procedural**: You navigate to what you need (link following)
- **Metacognitive feeling**: You get an "Aha!" when connections click

The organization is fractal—each concept page is self-sufficient yet connected, just like thoughtseeds in competition.
