# Frameworks

High-level **integrating** frameworks that organize existing Dionysus modules toward a given goal. They sit *above* specs, implementation docs, and concept pages—they do not replace them.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Persuasion Architecture (Integrated)](./persuasion-architecture-integrated.md) | Neuronal packets × mental models × copywriting: a lens for structuring persuasion (IAS, campaigns, offer design). |

**Rule:** When using a framework, **map explicitly** to existing docs (see each doc’s “Dionysus mapping” section). Avoid duplicating or conflicting with module-specific specs.
