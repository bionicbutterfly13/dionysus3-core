# Persuasion Architecture Integrated Framework

## Why
- Distill the comprehensive "Neuronal Packets × Mental Models × Copywriting" report into a **higher-level organizing lens** for persuasion (IAS, campaigns, offer design).
- Provide a **piecewise** structure (packets → mental models → copywriting → IAS) while preserving the bigger picture.
- Ensure **no confusion** with existing modules: neuronal packets implementation, mental-model specs, COPY_GUIDE, IAS curriculum.

## What changed
- Added **`docs/frameworks/`** with:
  - **`README.md`** – Index for integrating frameworks; rule: map explicitly to existing docs, no duplication.
  - **`persuasion-architecture-integrated.md`** – Distilled framework:
    - Part I: Three domains (packets, 3-level mental models, Makepeace copywriting).
    - Part II: Integrated mapping (packet phase ↔ benefit type ↔ mental-model level).
    - Part III: Faux benefits (attention gating, how to spot).
    - Part IV: Offer architecture (base, premiums, risk reversal, highest-value first).
    - Part V: IAS application (Level 1/2/3, narrative beats).
    - Part VI: Measurement hypotheses.
    - **Part VII: Dionysus mapping** – Clear table relating this framework to `neuronal_packets_architecture`, Neural Packets concept, spec 030, COPY_GUIDE, IAS, skills. Explicit "what this does **not** replace" and "how to use."
- Updated **`docs/index.md`** – Linked Frameworks under Concepts & Philosophy.

## Notes
- Framework **orients** existing work; it does not add new implementation. COPY_GUIDE remains source of truth for IAS copy; neuronal-packets and 030 specs unchanged.
- When using the framework for campaigns or IAS articulation: sequence benefits by packet phase (functional → dimensionalized → emotional) and by mental-model level (research → adapt → commit).
