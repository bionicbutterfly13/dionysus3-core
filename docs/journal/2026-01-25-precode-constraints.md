# Pre-Code Constraints Requirement

## Why
- Ensure every agent reads the project constraints before writing or changing code.
- Prevent disconnected or non-compliant changes by making constraints the first step in the workflow.

## What Changed
- Added a pre-code requirement to read `.conductor/constraints.md` in `conductor/workflow.md`.
- Added the same pre-code requirement in `README.md` under Conductor Protocol Required.

## Notes
- This reinforces the constraints as the primary, mandatory reference for all agents.
