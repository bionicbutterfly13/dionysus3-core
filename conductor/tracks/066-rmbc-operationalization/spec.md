# Spec: RMBC & Bullet Campaign System Operationalization

**Track ID**: 066-rmbc-operationalization
**Objective**: Ingest RMBC 2.0 and Bullet Campaign methodologies not as static text, but as an executable "Copywriting Engine".

## Core Philosophy: "The Ultrathink"
*   **Inversion**: The System interviews the User (Drafting via Interrogation).
*   **Cognitive Offloading**: The System holds the Structure; the User provides the Flow.
*   **Validation**: Audio-first verification (ElevenLabs) for rhythm and voice.

## Source Material
*   `/Volumes/Arkham/Marketing/stefan/Stefan Georgi - RMBC II`
*   `02-DEEP RESEARCH`
*   `03-UNIQUE MECHANISMS`
*   `05-BRIEF 20`

## Success Criteria
1.  **Extraction**: Complete extraction of Mechanism and Brief logic.
2.  **Skill**: `061-rmbc-methodology` acts as a functioning rulebook.
3.  **Workflow**: A demonstratable "Brief Builder" interaction.
