## Executive Summary

After systematic analysis of 14 source documents (~640KB), I identified:
- **3 NOT CONFLICTS** - Content that appears conflicting but serves different purposes
- **3 ACTUAL CONFLICTS** - Require explicit resolution
- **8 UNIQUE ELEMENTS** - Must be preserved in canonical document

---

## NOT CONFLICTS (Complementary Systems)

### 1. Three Avatar Systems

These are NOT conflicting - they serve THREE DIFFERENT marketing purposes:

| System | Source Document | Purpose | Use Case |
|--------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| **Awareness-Level Avatars** | Avatars by awareness 12_4.md | Funnel stage targeting | Ads, email sequences, sales page sections |
| **MAD Method Characters** | 3 Avatars 11_8 MAD MEthod.md | Narrative archetypes | Headlines, hooks, storytelling |
| **Client Stories** | ground-truth/*.md | Social proof | Case studies, testimonials |

**RESOLUTION:** Keep all three systems. Document their distinct purposes.

### 2. Marketing Research Documents

These are COMPLEMENTARY research, not conflicts:
- `IAS Noise PAges .md` - Objections, claims, offer structure
- `Competitor Analysis_ Suppressed Empath Executives.md` - Market positioning
- `Psychographic Research For High-Net-Worth Buyers.md` - Deep buyer psychology

**RESOLUTION:** Merge into unified Marketing Assets section.

### 3. Curriculum vs Workshop Script

- `IAS MOSAEIC Source of Truth.md` - COMPLETE curriculum (authoritative)
- `THE INNER ARCHITECT SYSTEM_ WORKSHOP SCRIPT.md` - ABBREVIATED version (derivative)

**RESOLUTION:** IAS MOSAEIC Source of Truth is authoritative. Workshop script can be deprecated.

---

## ACTUAL CONFLICTS (Require Resolution)

### CONFLICT 1: Transformation Statements Duplicate Files

**Files:**
- `Transformation Statements.md` (2KB)
- `Transformation Statements (1).md` (1KB)

**Issue:** Two versions of same content exist

**Content Comparison:**
Both discuss memory reconsolidation vs. counteractive change. The larger file has more detail.

**RECOMMENDATION:** Merge, using larger file as base. Keep unique content from smaller file.

**STATUS:** 🔄 Can resolve automatically

---

### CONFLICT 2: Price Points Vary Across Documents

**Observed Values:**
- `$97` - Tripwire (IAS Noise Pages)
- `$3,975` - Mentioned in core-conversion-content-template
- `$5,475` - Mentioned in Avatars document

**Issue:** Which is the current canonical pricing?

**RECOMMENDATION:** ⚠️ USER INPUT REQUIRED - Please confirm current pricing structure.

**STATUS:** 🛑 Needs user clarification

---

### CONFLICT 3: 5 Desires Wording Verification

**Source 1:** `The 5 Deep Desires of Your Avatar.md`
1. Authenticity
2. Connection
3. Purpose
4. Confidence
5. Peace

**Source 2:** `analytical-empath-avatar-source-of-truth.md` (existing ground-truth)
- Need to verify exact wording matches

**Issue:** Potential wording inconsistency between documents

**RECOMMENDATION:** Compare exact phrasing. Use most complete version.

**STATUS:** 🔄 Can verify and resolve

---

## UNIQUE ELEMENTS TO PRESERVE

Each of these contains content that doesn't exist elsewhere:

| Element | Source | Unique Content |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| **Complete 9-Lesson Curriculum** | IAS MOSAEIC Source of Truth.md | Full scripts, obstacles, solutions for all lessons |

| **MAD Method Hooks** | 3 Avatars 11_8 MAD MEthod.md | Industry-specific headlines, hooks |
| **20 Objections + Responses** | IAS Noise PAges .md | Complete objection handling |
| **20 Marketing Claims** | IAS Noise PAges .md | Provable marketing statements |
| **Competitor Positioning** | Competitor Analysis.md | Market differentiation strategy |
| **HNW Psychographics** | Psychographic Research.md | Deep buyer psychology |
