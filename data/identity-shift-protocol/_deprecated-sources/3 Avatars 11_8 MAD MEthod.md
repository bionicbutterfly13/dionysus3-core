**Hey chat, we are going to create 3 customer personas for my inner architect system signature program . I will be giving you the following: \- a copy of my curriculum \- and 30-50 reviews that I scraped I need you to analyze the product page and list out the following: \- Benefits \- Outcomes that our customer wants \- Their desired results Then I'll give you the 30-50 amazon reviews and I want to understand the following: \- Swipeable language I can use in my creatives \- Emotionally charged language they use \- Their goals \- Their pain points \- Their objections \- What they must accept to be true for them to believe that my product is the right one for them \- Their desired outcome \- Their purchasing behavior \- Their motivations \- Decision making factors how they make decisions \- other solutions they have tried, considered, or bought (can be direct, secondary, or indirect competition) Then we will craft the following: \- The customer avatar \- The demographics of this customer avatar \- The psychographics of this customer avatar Does this all make sense?I'm going to be sharing my product curriculum with you so you can help me find 3 target avatars that would benefit greatly and be able to afford my signature offerings which are a $15,000 for 90 days one on one program and a $3275 90-day hybrid group self-paced 9 \-llesson recording and weekly group calls program (only that price during the pilot) Our program also comes with an AI-powered system that has nine sub-programs, one program to help with the exercises in each lesson. They step through each section with the person, help them brainstorm along the way, and help them get a better understanding of their belief systems and so on. Thelessons y are heavily AI-dependent software mobile appThat uses my proprietary systemI'm going to provide you with some of the possibly down-market offers like book reviews and some courses I can find, but I would very much like for you to find the up-market competitors. This right now is not the focus of that, but it's just that I want you to find them and use them when you're considering my three avatars. As a matter of fact, I'm gonna have you find the Amazon reviews and stuff because I know you can. Essentially, based off what you know about my product, let me give you the curriculum So some things to consider: I'm looking for the sub-characteristics of being analytical empaths with a touch of ADD, midlife crisis. They've worked hard, have a lot of success, but feel a bit of frustration because they found themselves at this point in life and they realized that they could have been so much more. And they realize even now that they've come to grips with their full talent, and their life doesn't match that. Maybe the people around them who they train with have had more success. And they wonder why life hasn't really worked out for them like it did for, seems like everyone else. So analytical empaths with a bit of ADHD looking to turn things around now. Despite their success, just looking to feel more control of themselves and less corona (inner critic and self-sabotage), and procrastination. Their own way type of stuff Another thing about them is they've tried just about everything out there under the sun. They're very into their science, whoever they are, even if they're in art or whatever, there's a part of them that loves the empirical data. My program is very heavily based around things like memory reconsolidation, active inference, theory of mind, just some of the deeper stuff Another point is they're not really into that regular weekly personal coaching. So I plan to have weekly drop-bys, so they can drop by or they can just listen to the recording. And there'll be some, once a month, at the beginning of the month, there'll be sort of a deeper group lecture. They can come or not. So mainly the weekly coaching is more of a drop-by with your specific problem, work through it. We know they're busy and don't really feel like sitting through other people's stuff. So they just sign up and come through And often they can come through and we can work through the AI for that lecture with them**

Perfect\! This makes complete sense and aligns beautifully with what you already know about your market. Let me now create the comprehensive customer persona documents with all the detailed analysis you requested.

⁂

**let's give each a memorable name and What is this customer's journey through their daily, weekly, and monthly routines This will help us resonate with specific stages of the customer's journey are more like to capture their attention, interest, emotional connection, and make it personal to them. What motivates the customer? What is their current pain point? Figure out why they have the problem? What is the outcome they want by purchasing your product?**

Of course. Let's breathe more life into these avatars by giving them memorable names and mapping out their inner and outer worlds. This will illuminate exactly where and how the Inner Architect System can intercept their journey.

Here are the detailed customer journey maps for our three core personas.

**Avatar 1: "The Plateaued Pro" \- Alex**

**"I'm successful by every metric, so why do I feel like I'm falling behind?"**

**Customer Journey & Routines**

* **Daily Routine:** Alex's day starts before sunrise, immediately checking emails and the market news, already feeling a step behind. The day is a blur of back-to-back Zoom calls where they are decisive and respected, but they feel like they are playing a part. They often work through lunch to "get ahead," but the to-do list is endless. The evenings are spent catching up on the "real work" they couldn't get to during the day, leaving them too mentally exhausted for family or personal projects. Before bed, they find themselves scrolling through LinkedIn, a painful habit of comparing their career trajectory to that of their peers, which fuels a quiet sense of inadequacy.

* **Weekly Routine:** The week is a tactical gauntlet of deadlines, team management, and putting out fires. On Friday, there's a fleeting sense of relief, quickly replaced by the nagging feeling of, "Another week gone, but what did I actually build? What did I move forward that truly matters?" The weekend is a frantic attempt to recharge and be present for family, but their mind is a constant buzz of unresolved work problems and a low-grade anxiety about Monday morning.

* **Monthly Routine:** Each month is bookended by high-stakes pressure—board reports, performance reviews, and strategic planning sessions. It's during the brief lulls after these peaks that the core pain surfaces most acutely. The quiet moments are the most dangerous, filled with the question, "Is this it? I've worked this hard for *this* feeling?" This is when Alex is most likely to search for "executive coaching for fulfillment" or "how to overcome imposter syndrome."

**Core Motivation & Pain**

* **What Motivates Alex?** The primary driver is a deep, urgent need to close the ever-widening gap between their perceived potential and their current reality. It's a race against the clock to build a legacy that feels authentic and meaningful before it feels "too late."

* **What is their Current Pain Point?** A persistent, soul-crushing feeling of professional unfulfillment and stagnation, despite having achieved all the external markers of success. It's the profound emptiness of "hollow success."

* **Why Do They Have This Problem?** Alex's identity and self-worth are fundamentally fused with their external achievements. This, combined with a relentless inner critic and deep-seated perfectionism, creates a paralyzing fear of failure. They avoid the very risks required for a breakthrough (e.g., a new venture, a bold career move) because it would expose them to the possibility of not being "the best."

* **Desired Outcome of Purchasing:** To finally feel an internal sense of confidence and alignment that is independent of external validation. Alex wants to lead with authenticity, make bold decisions without the debilitating self-doubt, and feel that their success is a true reflection of their potential, not just a part they play.

**Avatar 2: "The Compassionate Founder" \- Sarah**

**"My business is thriving, but it's costing me myself."**

**Customer Journey & Routines**

* **Daily Routine:** Sarah wakes up feeling a sense of dread, not from lack of passion, but from the sheer weight of responsibility. Her phone is the first thing she checks, immediately being pulled into client emergencies and team questions. Her day is spent in "reaction mode"—solving problems for everyone else, giving her energy to her clients, and being the emotional backstop for her team. Lunch is an afterthought. She ends the day completely depleted, with zero energy left for her own needs, her family, or the strategic "CEO work" her business desperately needs.

* **Weekly Routine:** The week is a whirlwind of client delivery and emotional labor. The "wins"—a happy client, a project completed—feel good for a moment, but the cost is her own well-being. She feels immense guilt if she blocks off time for herself or says "no" to a request. She knows the business runs *on* her, and the thought of stepping away is terrifying.

* **Monthly Routine:** The end-of-month financial review brings a mixed bag of pride and anxiety. Revenue is good, but she knows she's at her absolute capacity. This is when the search for a solution becomes critical. She'll look for "business scaling systems" or "how to beat entrepreneur burnout," thinking it's a systems problem, not yet realizing the bottleneck is her own internal operating system and lack of boundaries.

**Core Motivation & Pain**

* **What Motivates Sarah?** To build a business that makes a significant impact *without* requiring her self-sacrifice. She is motivated by the idea of sustainable success, where her company can grow and thrive, and so can she.

* **What is their Current Pain Point?** Chronic, bone-deep burnout and a frightening loss of her own identity. Her empathy has become a liability, leading to porous boundaries and a feeling that she exists only to serve the needs of others.

* **Why Do They Have This Problem?** Sarah's core belief is that her value is directly tied to her service and availability. Her empathy is the engine of her business's success but the source of her personal downfall. She fears that setting boundaries or prioritizing herself will be seen as selfish and will cost her clients, her reputation, and her business's success.

* **Desired Outcome of Purchasing:** To learn how to lead from a place of "overflow" instead of depletion. Sarah wants to install the internal "architecture" that allows her to set strong, guilt-free boundaries, protect her energy, and build systems that let her business scale beyond her direct, hour-to-hour involvement. She wants to be the architect of her business, not just its primary engine.

**Avatar 3: "The Brilliant Bottleneck" \- Mark**

**"My brain is my biggest asset and my greatest enemy."**

**Customer Journey & Routines**

* **Daily Routine:** Mark's day begins with a flash of genius—a brilliant solution to a complex problem. But before he can act, he's derailed by a flood of notifications. He spends the morning struggling to initiate the "most important task," instead falling down a rabbit hole of research on a new, more interesting idea (hyperfocus). A surge of panic and adrenaline hits around 3 PM as a deadline looms, and he pulls off a heroic feat to get it done just in time. The day ends with a mix of relief and shame—he "got away with it" again, reinforcing his imposter syndrome.

* **Weekly Routine:** Mark's week is a rollercoaster of productivity. He'll have one or two days of god-like focus where he produces a week's worth of work. These are inevitably followed by days of scattered attention, procrastination, and fighting mental fog. "Sunday Scaries" are especially potent as he's haunted by the critical, high-impact tasks he avoided all week.

* **Monthly Routine:** He starts each month with a new set of ambitious goals and a meticulously designed new productivity system (a new app, a new journal, a new methodology). By mid-month, the system is invariably abandoned, overwhelmed by its own rigidity. He sees his less-brilliant but more consistent peers get promotions or ship side-projects, which fuels his deep frustration. This is his trigger moment to search for "ADHD productivity hacks" or "coaching for tech professionals."

**Core Motivation & Pain**

* **What Motivates Mark?** To finally achieve consistency. He is intensely motivated by the desire to have his real-world output finally match his vast intellectual potential. It's not about impressing others; it's about proving to *himself* that he can be as brilliant in execution as he is in ideation.

* **What is their Current Pain Point?** A chaotic and frustrating cycle of high potential followed by inconsistent performance. This breeds a deep-seated imposter syndrome and a painful sense of wasted talent that is both exhausting and demoralizing.

* **Why Do They Have This Problem?** Mark's analytical ADHD brain struggles with executive functions like planning, prioritization, and task initiation. This is amplified by a perfectionistic streak: if he can't execute an idea "perfectly," he'd rather not start at all. This combination of a racing mind and a fear of flawed execution is the perfect storm for self-sabotaging procrastination.

* **Desired Outcome of Purchasing:** To install a new internal "operating system" that works *with* his ADHD, not against it. Mark wants to transform his intellectual horsepower into consistent, tangible, and fulfilling results without the constant stress, anxiety, and self-flagellation. He wants a system for his mind that's as elegant as the systems he designs at work.

**\- Sarah, give me somebody elseHer name, I'm sick of seeing Sarah- They're seeing Alex. I need a different name in my mind Do these three people map to the empathic entrepreneur, the accomplished underachiever?I have a former with adhd**

Of course. Let's refresh those names to make them more distinct and confirm the mapping to the core avatars.

Understood on changing the names. Let's make them more memorable.

* We'll rename **Sarah** (The Compassionate Founder) to **Elena**.

* We'll rename **Alex** (The Plateaued Pro) to **Michael**.

* **Mark** (The Brilliant Bottleneck) can remain.

And to confirm the mapping, you are absolutely correct. Here is the explicit connection between the avatars we've developed:

1. **Michael ("The Plateaued Pro")** is your **Accomplished Underachiever**. He's the high-level professional who looks successful on the outside but feels unfulfilled and stalled on the inside, constantly comparing himself to peers.

2. **Elena ("The Compassionate Founder")** is your **Empathic Entrepreneur**. She's the business owner who is brilliant at what she does but is burning out from giving everything to her clients and team, losing herself in the process.

3. **Mark ("The Brilliant Bottleneck")** is your **Analytical High Performer with ADHD**. He's the gifted professional whose brilliant, non-linear mind is both his greatest asset and the source of his self-sabotaging inconsistency and procrastination.

The core journeys, pains, and motivations we just outlined map directly to these three distinct avatars. We can now move forward using the names **Michael, Elena, and Mark**.

**I want to align different creative formats with each customer avatar. Please help me understand which creative formats would work best for each customer avatar. Here are the creative formats: \- Reels \- Carousels \- Multi benefit highlighter \- Founders video \- Testimonial \- Before and after \- Authority/creditbility**

Excellent question. Aligning the right creative format with the right avatar is critical for cutting through the noise and making an instant connection. Let's break down which formats will resonate most powerfully with Michael, Elena, and Mark based on their unique psychographics and media consumption habits.

**Matching Creative Formats to Customer Avatars**

This table provides a quick overview, followed by a detailed rationale for each avatar.

| Creative Format | Michael (Accomplished Underachiever) | Elena (Empathic Entrepreneur) | Mark (Analytical w/ ADHD) |
| :---- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Reels** | Low | **High** | Medium |
| **Carousels** | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| **Multi-Benefit Highlighter** | **High** | Medium | Low |
| **Founder's Video** | Medium | **High** | Medium |
| **Testimonial** | **High** | **High** | **High** |
| **Before-and-After** | **High** | Medium | **High** |
| **Authority/Credibility** | **Very High** | Medium | **Very High** |

**1\. Michael ("The Plateaued Pro"): The Accomplished Underachiever**

Michael is analytical, status-conscious, and skeptical. He consumes media on platforms like LinkedIn and values data, proof, and efficiency. His creative strategy should focus on building trust and demonstrating a clear, logical ROI for his time and money.

* **Primary Formats:**

  * **Authority/Credibility (Very High):** This is the most crucial format for Michael. He needs to see *your* credentials. Posts featuring your scientific methodology (memory reconsolidation, active inference), your own high-achieving background, or features in reputable publications (even guest posts on business blogs) will immediately signal that you are a peer who understands his world. This format builds the initial trust required for him to even consider your offer.

  * **Testimonial (High):** Specifically, testimonials from other high-level executives or professionals. When he sees someone with a similar title (VP, Director, Partner) describing their transformation from "hollow success" to "aligned fulfillment," it provides the powerful social proof he needs. The more specific the testimonial is to his pain point, the better.

  * **Carousels (High):** This format is perfect for his analytical mind. You can create carousels that break down complex concepts (e.g., "The 5 Signs of Executive Burnout You're Ignoring" or "How Your Inner Architect Creates a 'Success Ceiling'"). This allows him to consume logical, structured information at his own pace and demonstrates your intellectual rigor.

  * **Before-and-After (High):** Frame this as a "State Transformation." **Before:** A respected VP, but feeling like a fraud, constantly second-guessing decisions, and comparing himself to peers. **After:** The same VP, now leading with authentic confidence, making bold moves, and feeling a sense of deep satisfaction in his role. The contrast speaks directly to his desired outcome.

* **Secondary Formats:**

  * **Multi-Benefit Highlighter:** Effective if it focuses on tangible outcomes like "Enhanced Decision-Making," "Increased Executive Presence," and "Sustainable High Performance."

  * **Founder's Video:** A professionally shot video where you speak directly to the pressures and paradoxes of high achievement can be effective, but it must be concise, intelligent, and highly polished.

* **Least Effective Format:**

  * **Reels:** Fast-paced, entertainment-focused Reels are likely to be perceived as low-value or unprofessional by Michael in his primary research phase. He's not scrolling Instagram for career solutions.

**2\. Elena ("The Compassionate Founder"): The Empathic Entrepreneur**

Elena is driven by connection, authenticity, and story. She spends time on more personal platforms like Instagram and Substack and is drawn to leaders who are vulnerable and values-aligned. Your creative strategy must build a deep emotional connection and make her feel seen and understood.

* **Primary Formats:**

  * **Founder's Video (High):** This is your most powerful tool for Elena. A video where you share your own story—your struggles with burnout, empathy overload, or losing yourself in your mission—will create an instant, powerful bond. Your vulnerability gives her permission to acknowledge her own. She needs to feel your empathy before she will trust your system.

  * **Testimonial (High):** Testimonials from other founders or service-based entrepreneurs are crucial. When Elena hears another woman say, "I thought I had to sacrifice myself for my business, but this program taught me how to scale my impact *and* get my life back," it's a deeply resonant message of hope. Video testimonials are especially powerful here.

  * **Reels (High):** Short, value-driven Reels that speak directly to her pain can be very effective (e.g., a 30-second video on "The Guilt of Setting Boundaries as a Founder" or "Why Empathy is Your Superpower, Not Your Kryptonite"). This format allows you to show up consistently and build a relationship over time.

  * **Carousels (High):** Use carousels to tell stories and share emotional truths. Titles like "A Story of a Founder Who Lost Herself" or "3 Mindset Shifts to Heal Empathy Burnout" will draw her in. Focus on emotional connection over dense data.

* **Secondary Formats:**

  * **Before-and-After:** Frame this as an "Energy Transformation." **Before:** A photo of a founder looking drained and overwhelmed at her laptop. **After:** The same founder looking energized, present, and joyful. The visual story of reclaiming one's life is powerful.

* **Least Effective Format:**

  * **Multi-Benefit Highlighter:** A list of abstract benefits will not connect with her as much as a single, powerful story. She responds to emotion and narrative, not just feature lists.

**3\. Mark ("The Brilliant Bottleneck"): The Analytical High Performer with ADHD**

Mark is highly intelligent, novelty-seeking, and deeply skeptical of "fluffy" solutions. He lives on platforms like Reddit, YouTube, and technical blogs where deep-dives and evidence are prized. Your creative must prove you understand the *neuroscience* of his struggle and offer a system that is as smart as he is.

* **Primary Formats:**

  * **Authority/Credibility (Very High):** For Mark, this means showcasing your understanding of the science. Posts that mention "active inference," "executive function," or the "neuroscience of focus" are catnip. Diagrams, frameworks, and scientific citations in your content will build immense trust. You need to prove you have a system, not just suggestions. The AI-powered component of your program is a massive credibility booster for this avatar.

  * **Carousels (High):** This is Mark's preferred learning format. Create detailed, educational carousels that explain a system or framework (e.g., "The Procrastination Loop: An Active Inference Model" or "How to Build an 'External Brain' That Works for the ADHD Mind"). He will read every single slide if the content is intelligent and offers a new way of thinking.

  * **Before-and-After (High):** This should be a "Process Transformation." **Before:** A whiteboard covered in brilliant but chaotic and unfinished ideas, a desk littered with half-read books. **After:** A single, completed project, a clear and simple system, a look of focused calm. This demonstrates the transformation from chaos to elegant execution.

  * **Testimonial (High):** Testimonials must be from other tech professionals, academics, or creatives. The most powerful message would be, "I always knew I was smart, but I could never be consistent. This program gave me the operating manual for my own brain."

* **Secondary Formats:**

  * **Reels (Medium):** Can work if they are "brain-hack" or "neuroscience-explainer" style videos. Think short, animated explainers or a quick breakdown of a complex concept. They must be educational, not just entertaining.

  * **Founder's Video:** Effective if it positions you as a fellow "systems thinker" who became obsessed with finding a better model for a specific type of brain.

* **Least Effective Format:**

  * **Multi-Benefit Highlighter:** Mark is immune to vague benefit lists. He will see it as marketing fluff. He needs to understand the *mechanism* by which the benefits are achieved, not just what they are.

**Okay, chat now I need to create hooks and headlines for each of these customer avatars. Keep in mind the following: The hook is the beginning of the video we want to grab attention of the person who is scrolling on Facebook and instagram The headlines are used for static images and carousels.**

Of course. Crafting the right hook and headline is everything—it's the key that unlocks the door to your avatar's attention. Here is a comprehensive set of hooks (for video) and headlines (for images/carousels) tailored specifically to resonate with the deep-seated pains and desires of Michael, Elena, and Mark.
