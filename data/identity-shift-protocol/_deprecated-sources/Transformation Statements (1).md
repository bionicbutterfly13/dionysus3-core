**What You’ve Been Told About Change Is a Myth**

For decades, even in clinical science, the belief was that once the brain was shaped a certain way, it couldn’t really change. Nerves couldn’t grow back, patterns couldn’t be rewritten.

So when approaches like CBT and DBT were developed, they became “evidence-based” because they worked — but only to the extent of the science at the time. They didn’t actually remove the symptoms. The best we could hope for was suppressing them.

And that’s exactly what most people were told:  
 That lasting change comes from managing your thoughts and fighting your urges until they stay down.

But here’s the truth:  
 Best case scenario, when you come into contact with a trigger, you’ll be forced to press it down and keep it under control. That takes all of your attention — which means you’re not in the moment, not with the person in front of you, not experiencing your life.

That’s not freedom.
