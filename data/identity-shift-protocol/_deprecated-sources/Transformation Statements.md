**Hi, I’m \[Your Name\]**

There’s a shocking truth in the personal growth and therapy world that nobody’s talking about. And it’s costing people years of their lives. Yep, years.

Counteractive change.

Most approaches like CBT and DBT don’t actually dissolve the patterns at the root — they just teach people how to manage or override them. Which sounds helpful… until you realize what’s really happening.

The old scripts never go away. They’re still stored in the brain.  
 So instead of freedom, people end up with **two competing programs**:

* the unconscious pattern (fear, shame, trauma)

* and the new coping script they’ve memorized.

That means the feelings never truly leave — they just have to be fought off. The trauma remains, and in the wrong environment or under stress, those old scripts resurface.

Like this client who told me after two years of therapy:  
 **“I knew what to tell myself in the moment, but the same feelings always came back.”**

That’s why relapse is so common. People stay locked in a lifelong battle between conscious effort and unconscious instinct. And because the unconscious is more powerful, it leaves them fighting themselves every day just to barely cope.

**Slide 2 The Breakthrough That Actually Sets You Free**

Lasting change doesn’t come from fighting old scripts with new ones.  
 It comes from rewriting the script itself.

That’s what your brain is designed to do through a natural process called memory reconsolidation — the mechanism behind real transformation.

Instead of stacking coping strategies on top of trauma, it dissolves the old learning at its root.  
 So the same trigger that once hijacked you can show up again… and it simply has no power anymore.

**Like this client who had avoided the same street for years after a serious accident:**

*“Every time I approached it, my chest would tighten and I’d turn away. But after going through the steps in the Hidden Block Decoder, I drove past that street and realized — the old fear didn’t take over. The memory showed up, but this time I could put it into words. It didn’t grip me the way it used to.”*

That’s the difference.  
 Counteractive change leaves you fighting unconscious reactions forever.  
 The Hidden Block Decoder brings those blocks into the open — where you can finally see them, name them, and stop being controlled by them.
