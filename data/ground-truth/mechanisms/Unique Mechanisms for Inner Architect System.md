# **Cognitive Sovereignty and the Inner Architect: A Strategic Analysis of Unique Mechanisms for the High-Functioning Neurodivergent Leader**

## **1\. The Crisis of the Vigilant Sentinel: A Market Analysis**

The landscape of high-performance leadership is currently undergoing a profound, albeit silent, fragmentation. Within the upper echelons of corporate governance, entrepreneurship, and creative direction, a specific demographic is reaching a breaking point that traditional organizational psychology fails to address. This demographic is the "Twice Exceptional" (2e) executive—an individual possessing high intellectual giftedness alongside neurodevelopmental variations, predominantly Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).1 These individuals are not merely participants in the economy; they are often its "Vigilant Sentinels," the hyper-perceptive, analytical empaths who have constructed careers on a foundation of anxiety-driven overcompensation and intellectual brilliance.

However, for the "Problem Aware" segment of this market, the narrative of success has soured. These leaders are acutely conscious that their internal experience of chaos does not align with their external projection of control. They are operating in a state of "Quiet Collapse".1 They drive performance not through sustainable executive function, but through the unsustainable combustion of adrenal stress, leading to a specific pathology known as "Neurodivergent Burnout".1 This report analyzes the psychographic architecture of this avatar to propose specific "Unique Mechanisms" (UM) for the Inner Architect System. These mechanisms are designed to explain the root cause of their past failures (Unique Mechanism of the Problem \- UMP) and articulate the specific methodology of the new solution (Unique Mechanism of the Solution \- UMS).

### **1.1 The Psychophysics of the Problem Aware Sentinel**

To effectively engineer a Unique Mechanism, one must first deconstruct the lived reality of the target avatar. The Vigilant Sentinel is defined by a central paradox: the possession of a "Ferrari engine" for cognitive processing (high IQ, rapid pattern recognition) paired with "bicycle brakes" for executive regulation.1 This dissonance creates a distinct phenomenological experience characterized by "Executive Loneliness" 1 and "Impostor Syndrome" rooted in the fear that their disorganized internal reality will be exposed.2

The Sentinel's primary struggle is the management of "Cognitive Load".3 Unlike their neurotypical peers, whose brains automatically filter irrelevant sensory and emotional data, the Sentinel’s brain processes all incoming stimuli with equal weight. This leads to a rapid saturation of working memory, a state described in the literature as "Cognitive Bandwidth Depletion".4 The Sentinel is not just tired; they are structurally overloaded. They exist in a state of "Hypervigilance" 5, constantly scanning the environment for threats—a missed email, a subtle shift in a client's tone, a forgotten deadline. This hypervigilance is not a personality trait but a biological adaptation to a history of executive failures, a survival mechanism that has become a cage.6

### **1.2 The Failure of Legacy Interventions**

The Problem Aware Sentinel is sophisticated. They have likely engaged with the "Medical Model" (medication), the "Therapeutic Model" (talk therapy), and the "Productivity Model" (hustle culture). The failure of these interventions provides the fertile ground for the Inner Architect System's Unique Mechanism.

**The Failure of Standard Coaching:** Standard executive coaching relies on the assumption of a linear, consistent neurocognitive baseline. It utilizes "SMART Goals" and accountability structures that presume the client possesses the *initiation* capacity to execute the plan. For the Sentinel, the deficit is not in *knowing* the plan, but in the neurochemical ignition required to *start* the plan—a phenomenon known as the "Knowing-Doing Gap".7 When standard coaching fails, it reinforces the Sentinel’s shame, validating their internal narrative that they are "broken" or "lazy" rather than neurodivergent.1

**The Failure of Traditional Therapy:** While therapy addresses the emotional fallout of burnout, it often lacks the tactical urgency required by a C-suite leader. The Sentinel needs to manage a P\&L statement *while* experiencing sensory overload. Therapy that focuses solely on childhood trauma without providing "Prosthetic Executive Function" tools 8 leaves the Sentinel emotionally validated but professionally vulnerable.

**The Failure of Hustle Culture:** The prevailing ethos of "grind" and "discipline" is toxic to the Sentinel. Their nervous system is already in "Sympathetic Overdrive".9 Advice to "push harder" or "wake up earlier" exacerbates their "Allostatic Load" 10, pushing them further into physiological dysregulation and accelerating the burnout cycle.11

The Inner Architect System must therefore position itself as a "Third Way"—neither medical treatment nor generic coaching, but "Cognitive Architecture." The following sections detail five distinct Unique Mechanism pairings that bridge this gap.

## ---

**2\. Unique Mechanism 1: The Structural Integrity Model**

This mechanism leverages the metaphor of construction and architecture, appealing to the Sentinel’s desire for stability, systems, and tangible results. It reframes their struggle from a moral failure of discipline to a structural failure of support.

### **2.1 Unique Mechanism of the Problem (UMP): "Cognitive Subsidence"**

The Concept:  
The Sentinel feels their life is collapsing not because they are weak, but because they are experiencing "Cognitive Subsidence." Just as a building sinks when its foundation interacts poorly with the soil, the Sentinel’s career is sinking because it is built on a neurocognitive foundation that lacks "Load-Bearing" capacity for the weight they are carrying.  
The Scientific Basis:  
This mechanism is grounded in Cognitive Load Theory (CLT).12 CLT posits that working memory is a finite resource with a limited "Load Bearing Capacity".14 The neurotypical brain possesses inherent "Load-Bearing Walls"—automatic processes for filtering distractions, regulating emotions, and sequencing tasks. These processes run in the background, consuming minimal energy.  
The neurodivergent brain, however, often lacks these automatic structures. To compensate, the Sentinel builds "Anxiety Scaffolding"—using the stress hormones cortisol and norepinephrine to force the brain into focus.15 They create artificial urgency to replicate the function of a neurotypical executive system. While effective in the short term, anxiety is a corrosive building material. Over time, the chronic elevation of cortisol leads to the degradation of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex 16, literally eroding the brain's structural integrity.

The cracks the Sentinel feels—the brain fog, the decision fatigue, the sudden inability to write an email—are not signs of laziness. They are signs of **"Structural Failure"**.17 The anxiety foundation has liquefied under the pressure, leading to a "subsidence" of their executive capabilities. They are attempting to support a skyscraper of responsibility on a foundation of mud.

Narrative Integration:  
"You feel like you are constantly shoring up a collapsing building. You add more hours, more effort, more stress, yet the cracks in your performance continue to widen. This is not a failure of will; it is Cognitive Subsidence. You have built a massive professional structure on a foundation that lacks the biological 'Load-Bearing Walls' to support it. You have been using anxiety as your primary structural material, but anxiety is brittle. It works until it shatters. Your foundation hasn't just cracked; it has dissolved under the 'Allostatic Load' of your own success."

### **2.2 Unique Mechanism of the Solution (UMS): "Neuro-Adaptive Scaffolding"**

The Concept:  
The Inner Architect System does not ask the Sentinel to rebuild the foundation with the same flawed materials (willpower). Instead, it installs "Neuro-Adaptive Scaffolding"—an external, resilient framework that bears the cognitive load for the user.  
The Scientific Basis:  
This solution draws on the educational and psychological concept of "Scaffolding".18 Originally defined by Vygotsky as the support given to a learner to achieve a task they cannot yet do alone, in this context, it refers to "Environmental Scaffolding".  
The Inner Architect System functions as a **"Prosthetic Executive Function"**.8 It utilizes **"Cognitive Offloading"** 21 to transfer the weight of "low-value" executive tasks (scheduling, initiating, remembering) from the biological brain to an external system (AI agents, ritualized workflows, environmental cues).

The "Neuro-Adaptive" aspect is critical. Static planners fail the ADHD brain because they do not adapt to fluctuating dopamine levels. The Inner Architect’s scaffolding is dynamic; it tightens during periods of high stress and loosens during flow states.23 It acts as an **"Exoskeleton"** that mechanically initiates tasks when the biological ignition fails. By offloading the "maintenance" load, the system restores the structural integrity of the mind, allowing the Sentinel to focus entirely on "High-Value" pattern recognition.21

Narrative Integration:  
"The Inner Architect System installs Neuro-Adaptive Scaffolding around your life. We do not try to 'fix' your biology; we build a Prosthetic Executive Function that works with it. By deploying AI and dynamic workflows as 'Load-Bearing Elements' 24, we transfer the crushing weight of daily administration from your exhausted prefrontal cortex to a tireless external architecture. We replace your anxiety-scaffolding with a system that holds the roof up, so you are free to design the future."

**3\. Unique Mechanism 2: The Bio-Economic Model**

This mechanism appeals to the Sentinel’s analytical, asset-focused mindset. It treats cognitive energy not as a vague feeling, but as a hard currency ("Cognitive Capital") that is being systematically embezzled by inefficient biological processes.

### **3.1 Unique Mechanism of the Problem (UMP): "The Masking Tax"**

The Concept:  
The Sentinel is burnt out not because the work is too hard, but because they are paying a hidden surcharge on every transaction: "The Masking Tax."  
The Scientific Basis:  
"Masking" or "Camouflaging" is the suppression of natural neurodivergent behaviors to conform to social norms.25 For the Sentinel, this involves suppressing stims, feigning linear attention, and constantly monitoring social subtext.  
Biologically, masking is an energy-intensive process mediated by the prefrontal cortex. It requires **Inhibitory Control**, a high-order executive function that consumes significant amounts of **Glucose**.27 The brain is a metabolic engine; it accounts for 20% of the body’s energy consumption. When the Sentinel spends 8 hours a day masking, they are diverting glucose away from critical thinking and towards social performance.

This leads to **"Glucose Depletion"** 28 and **"Ego Depletion"**.29 By mid-afternoon, the Sentinel experiences "Decision Fatigue" not because they have made too many strategic decisions, but because they have made thousands of micro-decisions to "act normal." They are operating in a state of **"Metabolic Bankruptcy,"** where the "Opportunity Cost" of masking is the loss of their strategic genius.8

Narrative Integration:  
"You aren't just tired; you are suffering from metabolic embezzlement. Every day, you pay a 'Masking Tax'—spending 40% of your brain's glucose reserves just to filter your impulses, feign eye contact, and 'pass' as neurotypical. This invisible expenditure depletes the fuel you need for high-level strategy. You are energy bankrupt by 2:00 PM, not because you outworked your peers, but because you are paying a surcharge they don't even know exists."

### **3.2 Unique Mechanism of the Solution (UMS): "Cognitive Asset Protection"**

The Concept:  
The Inner Architect System acts as a "Wealth Manager" for the brain’s energy. It implements "Cognitive Asset Protection" protocols to eliminate the Masking Tax and maximize "Neural ROI."  
The Scientific Basis:  
This solution focuses on "Allostatic Load Management".14 The system identifies the specific environments and interactions that trigger high-cost masking and restructures them. It creates "Vigilance-Free Zones" 5—curated peer environments (the "Third Space" 32\) where masking is explicitly forbidden, allowing the nervous system to recover and glucose reserves to replenish.  
Furthermore, the system uses **"Cognitive Load Displacement"**.33 By using AI to handle communication drafts and scheduling, the system reduces the "Activation Energy" required for tasks. It treats the Sentinel’s attention as a non-renewable resource that must be protected with the same rigor as financial capital. The solution is not "self-care"; it is **"Energy Economics."**

Narrative Integration:  
"We stop the leak. The Inner Architect System implements a Cognitive Asset Protection protocol. First, we identify the 'High-Tax' masking behaviors draining your battery and systematically eliminate them through environmental design. Second, we install 'Energy Derivatives'—AI systems that handle the friction of execution. The result is the reclamation of 15+ hours of high-performance capacity per week. We don't give you more time; we stop the theft of your energy."

## ---

**4\. Unique Mechanism 3: The Network Interference Model**

This mechanism is the most scientifically rigorous, tailored for the "Skeptical Optimizer." It frames the problem as a hardware conflict between specific brain networks, moving the conversation from psychology to neuroscience.

### **4.1 Unique Mechanism of the Problem (UMP): "Default Mode Interference"**

The Concept:  
The Sentinel’s inability to focus is not a lack of willpower; it is a "Signal Jamming" issue caused by "Default Mode Interference."  
The Scientific Basis:  
The human brain oscillates between two primary, anti-correlated networks:

1. **The Task Positive Network (TPN):** Active during goal-oriented tasks, focus, and external attention.34  
2. **The Default Mode Network (DMN):** Active during rest, introspection, mind-wandering, and self-referential thought.36

In a neurotypical brain, these networks operate like a seesaw: when the TPN goes up, the DMN goes down. In the ADHD/2e brain, this suppression mechanism is faulty. The DMN fails to deactivate when the TPN engages.38 This is **"Network Interference."**

The Sentinel tries to focus on a spreadsheet (TPN), but their brain is simultaneously replaying a conversation from yesterday or worrying about tomorrow (DMN). This "split signal" creates constant internal noise ("Brain Chatter"), reducing processing speed and increasing error rates. Crucially, the DMN is the seat of the "Ego" and "Rumination" 36, which explains why the Sentinel is plagued by negative self-talk and Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) during work hours.

Narrative Integration:  
"Your brain is fighting a civil war. In most people, the Focus Network (TPN) and the Daydream Network (DMN) take turns. In your brain, they are shouting over each other. This is Default Mode Interference. When you try to work, your DMN keeps injecting static—worries, ideas, memories—into your TPN. You aren't distracted; you are enduring a neurological signal jam. You are trying to transmit high-fidelity leadership data through a channel full of static."

### **4.2 Unique Mechanism of the Solution (UMS): "The Flow State Switch"**

The Concept:  
The Inner Architect System provides the "Flow State Switch"—a set of protocols to manually override the DMN and lock the brain into the TPN.  
The Scientific Basis:  
The solution leverages the neuroscience of "Transient Hypofrontality".41 Flow state is biologically defined by the down-regulation of the prefrontal cortex and the silencing of the DMN. For the neurodivergent brain, flow (Hyperfocus) is often accidental. The Inner Architect System makes it intentional.  
The mechanism involves **"Neuro-Somatic Anchoring"**—using specific sensory inputs (binaural beats, breathwork, vestibular stimulation) to forcibly suppress DMN activity.37 Additionally, the system utilizes **"Externalized Feedback Loops"**.42 Flow requires immediate feedback; the Inner Architect’s AI provides this high-frequency feedback, keeping the TPN engaged and preventing the DMN from re-asserting control. This turns the "bug" of hyperfocus into a controlled feature.

Narrative Integration:  
"We give you the codes to the 'Kill Switch' for the noise. The Inner Architect System teaches you Flow State Protocols—specific neuro-somatic triggers that silence the Default Mode Network on command. Instead of waiting for focus to strike by accident, you will learn to deploy your Task Positive Network with surgical precision. This is Cognitive Sovereignty: the ability to choose which network runs your mind, silencing the inner critic so the Inner Architect can build."

## ---

**5\. Unique Mechanism 4: The Evolutionary Model**

This mechanism reframes the "disorder" as an evolutionary mismatch, appealing to the Sentinel’s desire to see themselves as powerful rather than broken.

### **5.1 Unique Mechanism of the Problem (UMP): "Executive Function Atrophy"**

The Concept:  
The Sentinel is failing because they are attempting to run modern software (corporate administration) on incompatible hardware (a "Hunter" brain). This leads to "Executive Function Atrophy."  
The Scientific Basis:  
This mechanism draws on the "Hunter vs. Farmer" hypothesis.43 The ADHD brain is evolutionarily optimized for the "Hunter" environment: rapid scanning, high novelty, hyper-focus on threats, and bursts of intense energy. It is not wired for the "Farmer" environment: slow, linear, repetitive maintenance of crops (or spreadsheets).  
The Sentinel exerts immense effort trying to force their "Hunter" biology to perform "Farmer" tasks. This is bio-energetically inefficient. The more they force compliance, the more they degrade their natural strengths (creativity, crisis management). They experience **"Atrophy"** because they are underusing their strongest muscles (divergent thinking) and overusing their weakest ones (rote organization), leading to a systemic collapse of confidence and capability.44

Narrative Integration:  
"You are a Hunter trying to farm in a concrete jungle. Your brain is wired for rapid threat detection and strategic vision, not for the linear drudgery of modern administration. Every time you force yourself to color-code a calendar, you are fighting millions of years of evolution. You don't have a disorder; you have a Hardware-Software Mismatch. You are experiencing Executive Function Atrophy because you are trying to run a Fortune 500 company on a Paleolithic operating system designed for the hunt, not the harvest."

### **5.2 Unique Mechanism of the Solution (UMS): "The Exocortical Architect"**

The Concept:  
The Inner Architect System provides an "Exocortex"—an external, AI-driven layer of intelligence that acts as the "Farmer," liberating the "Hunter" to lead.  
The Scientific Basis:  
This solution is grounded in the Extended Mind Thesis (Clark & Chalmers) and the concept of "Prosthetic Prefrontal Cortex".45 The Inner Architect’s AI is not a tool; it is a "Cognitive Prosthetic." It is designed to handle the specific executive functions the Sentinel lacks: Working Memory (holding data), Initiation (starting tasks), and Sequencing (ordering steps).46  
By **"Offloading"** the "Farmer" tasks to the Exocortex 47, the Sentinel liberates their biological resources. The Unique Mechanism here is the **"Symbiotic Integration"**—the system learns the specific "Neuro-Signature" of the user, anticipating their executive deficits and patching them in real-time. It allows the user to remain in their "Zone of Genius" (Hunting) while the Exocortex tends the farm.

Narrative Integration:  
"Stop trying to fix your brain and start augmenting it. The Inner Architect System installs an Exocortex—an AI-driven executive layer that handles the linear load your biology rejects. This is not just an app; it is a Prosthetic Prefrontal Cortex. It remembers so you can forget. It organizes so you can create. It allows you to remain a Hunter, while the Exocortical Architect handles the harvest. This is the next stage of your evolution."

## ---

**6\. Unique Mechanism 5: The Polyvagal Safety Model**

This mechanism addresses the emotional core of the Sentinel—the anxiety, the trauma of "being found out," and the physiological cost of fear.

### **6.1 Unique Mechanism of the Problem (UMP): "Sympathetic Overdrive"**

The Concept:  
The Sentinel is not just stressed; they are stuck in "Sympathetic Overdrive." Their nervous system perceives the workplace as a life-threat, locking them into a chronic fight-flight-freeze state that inhibits higher cognition.  
The Scientific Basis:  
High-functioning neurodivergent adults often develop Hypervigilance as a trauma response to early criticism.5 They constantly scan for threats (rejection, failure). This keeps the Locus Coeruleus (the brain's alarm center) firing, flooding the system with norepinephrine.15  
This state leads to **"Amygdala Hijack"**.49 When the amygdala is active, it inhibits the prefrontal cortex—the exact region needed for executive function. The Sentinel is trying to innovate while their body thinks it is being hunted. They cannot access their "Social Engagement System" (Ventral Vagal state), which is required for complex problem-solving and collaboration. The "Problem" is not the work; it is the **"Biological Incompatibility"** between their threat response and their professional demands.

Narrative Integration:  
"You are leading from a bunker. Your success is driven by Sympathetic Overdrive—a biological state of constant fight-or-flight. You perceive a missed deadline as a saber-toothed tiger. This hypervigilance kept you safe in the past, but now it is locking down your genius. You cannot access your highest cognitive functions because your amygdala has hijacked your prefrontal cortex. You are exhausted because you have been at war with your own environment for decades."

### **6.2 Unique Mechanism of the Solution (UMS): "Vagal Safety Architecture"**

The Concept:  
The Inner Architect System builds "Vagal Safety Architecture"—a system of peer co-regulation and somatic protocols that mechanically switch the nervous system from "Defense" to "Discovery."  
The Scientific Basis:  
This solution is based on Polyvagal Theory (Porges). The group coaching component is not just for networking; it acts as a "Co-Regulation Engine." By placing the Sentinel among peers who share their neurotype (the "Third Space" 32), the system provides the "Safety Cues" necessary to deactivate the threat response.51  
The mechanism includes **"Somatic Reset Protocols"**—specific physical interventions (e.g., deep pressure, physiological sighs) that stimulate the Vagus Nerve to engage the **Parasympathetic Nervous System**.52 This restores "Structural Integrity" to the attention span 15 and re-engages the prefrontal cortex. The "Unique Mechanism" is the creation of a **"Vigilance-Free Zone"** where the mask can be dropped without consequence.

Narrative Integration:  
"We build the one thing you have never had: a safe house. The Inner Architect System utilizes Vagal Safety Architecture to manually switch your nervous system from 'Defense Mode' to 'Discovery Mode.' Through curated peer co-regulation and somatic protocols, we convince your amygdala to stand down. When the Sentinel can finally sleep, the Architect can finally build. This is the only room in the world where you don't have to watch the door."

**7\. Comparative Analysis of Mechanisms: Data & Efficacy**

To assist in the selection of the optimal mechanism for the specific campaign, the following tables compare the mechanisms against the "Problem Aware" market's specific pain points.

**Table 1: The Bio-Metabolic Cost of the Sentinel (Basis for Mechanism 2\)**

| Activity | Neurotypical Cost | Sentinel Cost (Unmanaged) | Biological Mechanism Involved | Result |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Routine Admin** | Low (Automatic) | High (Effortful) | **Glucose Depletion** (PFC Activation) | Procrastination / Paralysis |

**8\. Strategic Synthesis: The "Inner Architect" Direct Response Narrative**

The "Inner Architect System" is not a singular tool; it is a **meta-system** that integrates these mechanisms. However, for the purpose of a direct response campaign targeting the Problem Aware Sentinel, the strongest narrative combines the **Structural Integrity** (Problem) and **Prosthetic Evolution** (Solution) models. This combination validates the *feeling* of collapse while offering a *futuristic* and *empowering* solution.

### **8.1 The "Hook" Articulation**

"You are the architect of your company’s success, but the tenant of a collapsing mind. You feel the cracks in the foundation—the brain fog at 2 PM, the paralysis before a simple email, the exhaustion that sleep doesn’t fix. You’ve tried to 'discipline' yourself into stability, but discipline is a roof; it cannot fix a broken foundation. Your problem isn't a lack of effort. It is a **Structural Integrity Failure** caused by **Cognitive Subsidence**."

### **8.2 The "Mechanism of the Problem" (The Twist)**

"Science reveals that high-functioning 2e leaders suffer from a specific biological friction called the **'Masking Tax.'** Because your brain’s **Default Mode Network** (the daydreamer) interferes with your **Task Positive Network** (the executor) 38, you spend 40% of your neural energy just forcing your brain to 'stay in lane.' This constant internal correction creates **Allostatic Overload**—a cumulative debt of stress that literally dissolves the synaptic bridges required for decision-making.31 You aren't burned out; you are *structurally compromised*."

### **8.3 The "Mechanism of the Solution" (The Pivot)**

"The Inner Architect System is not a coaching program; it is a **Neuro-Adaptive Scaffolding** project.18 We don't try to fix your biology; we build a **Prosthetic Executive Function** around it.8

1. **The Blueprint:** We map your unique **Neuro-Signature** to identify where the 'load' is too heavy.  
2. **The Scaffolding:** We deploy **AI-Augmented Agents** to act as your **Exocortex** 45, handling the administrative friction that drains your battery.  
3. **The Reinforcement:** We install **Vagal Safety Protocols** to silence the 'Sentinel' (your anxiety), allowing the 'Architect' (your genius) to reclaim the driver’s seat.

We turn your neurodivergence from a structural liability into a **Force Multiplier**.54"

## **9\. Conclusion**

The "Problem Aware" 2e executive does not want to be "healed" in a soft, therapeutic sense; they want to be "optimized" in a hard, strategic sense. They view their brains as high-performance engines that are currently misfiring. The Inner Architect System succeeds by acknowledging the *reality* of their biological cost (The Masking Tax/Allostatic Load) and offering a *mechanical* solution (Scaffolding/Prosthetic Executive Function).

By framing the solution as **"Cognitive Architecture"** rather than "Self-Help," the product bypasses the skepticism associated with generic coaching and positions itself as a necessary infrastructure investment for the high-net-worth leader. The ultimate promise is not just productivity; it is **Cognitive Sovereignty**—the structural freedom to think, lead, and live without the fear of collapse.

### **9.1 Actionable Terminology Recommendations**

* **UMP Keywords:** Cognitive Subsidence, The Masking Tax, Default Mode Interference, Sentinel-Architect Inversion, Allostatic Debt, Sympathetic Overdrive.  
* **UMS Keywords:** Neuro-Adaptive Scaffolding, Prosthetic Executive Function, The Exocortex, Vagal Safety Architecture, Cognitive Asset Protection, Flow State Switch.  
* **Key Metaphors:** The Vigilant Sentinel, The Inner Architect, Load-Bearing Walls, Foundation Cracks, Metabolic Currency, The Civil War in the Brain.
