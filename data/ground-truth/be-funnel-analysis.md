### 7. Strong Call-to-Action
"Get Access Now" - benefit-oriented, first-person, action-driven. Appears multiple times. Clear what happens when clicked.

## Funnel Structure
- Free value up front (course)
- Low ticket tripwire (book)
- High-ticket upsell (mastermind/university)

## Key Principle for Analytical Empaths

The Functional Protocol layout works because:
1. Respects intelligence - shows mechanism and process
2. De-risks the woo - frames shadow work as technical project
3. Tripwire logic - $97 looks like buying a System, not just advice

## Tone Adjustment Needed

Bulletproof uses Alpha signals (Industrial Grade, War, Kill excuses) - will repel Empaths.

Keep explicit headers, swap vocabulary:
- Lesson 1: The Weapon → Phase 1: The De-escalation Protocol
- Who this is NOT for (Aggressive) → Who will benefit most (Alignment)
- Industrial Grade Mindset → Neuroscience-Backed Regulation
- Stop Being Weak → Why Willpower Failed You (And What Works Instead)
