## THE 15 FACTORS SCORING

Score each 1-5. Higher total = shorter/leaner funnel needed.

| # | Factor | Score | Reasoning |
|---|--------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Market Awareness | 2 | Problem-aware but not solution-aware. Know they're exhausted/stuck but don't know "Split Self" or "architecture" framing. |
| 2 | Demonstrable Proof | 2 | Internal transformation is hard to show visually. No before/after photos. Relies on testimonial stories. |
| 3 | Price Point | 4 | $97 tripwire is impulse-buy range. Low friction. (Coaching at $3,975 would score 2) |
| 4 | Traffic Temperature | 2 | Cold traffic from paid ads. No existing relationship. |
| 5 | Brand Equity | 1 | New brand. Dr. Mani not yet known in market. No existing authority. |
| 6 | Perceived Risk | 3 | Moderate. Not health/medical claims. Psychological transformation. Money-back guarantee reduces risk. |
| 7 | Regulatory Load | 4 | Low. No FDA, FTC health claims. Coaching/personal development has fewer restrictions. |
| 8 | Offer Complexity | 3 | Moderate. 3-layer AI system needs explanation but not overwhelming. |
| 9 | Customer LTV | 5 | Very high. $97 → $3,975 → potential ongoing. Can afford longer/more expensive acquisition. |
| 10 | Urgency of Problem | 4 | High. 3 AM insomnia, burnout, relationship strain. Acute ongoing pain. |
| 11 | Competitive Saturation | 2 | Crowded market (therapy, coaching, self-help). Need differentiation. |
| 12 | Buying Context | 3 | Desktop for $97. Analytical buyers research. Mobile possible but desktop preferred. |
| 13 | Payment Friction | 4 | Standard checkout. $97 = low friction. Credit card, no application needed. |
| 14 | Social Proof | 3 | Have client stories (Dr. Danielle, Marcus, Nina). Need more video testimonials. |
| 15 | Time-to-Result | 2 | Slower. Identity transformation takes weeks/months. Not instant gratification. |

**TOTAL SCORE: 44/75**

## IAS FUNNEL ARCHITECTURE

### LAYER 1: TRAFFIC SOURCES

**Paid Ads (Cold Traffic)**
- Meta (Facebook/Instagram): Advertorial-style ads
- YouTube: Problem-aware content ads
- Google: Search intent capture

**Organic (Warm Traffic)**
- Podcast appearances
- Guest articles
- LinkedIn thought leadership

---

### LAYER 2: PRE-SELL / WARM-UP

**Option A: Advertorial Funnel**
```
Ad → Advertorial → $97 Sales Page → Cart → Thank You Bridge → $3,975 Offer
```

Advertorial angles (from task queue):
- "Why 71% Of CEOs Report Feeling Like 'Two Different People'"
- "The Replay Loop: Why Your Brain Won't Stop Processing"
- "Why Your Anxiety Isn't A Bug. It's Protective Architecture"

**Option B: Quiz Funnel**
```
Ad → Quiz ("Which Hidden Block Is Costing You Most?") → Results Page → $97 Sales Page → Cart
```

Quiz uses Layer 1 diagnostic questions:
1. Role Signal (leadership/management = sweet spot)
2. Pain Sophistication (high-performing outside, burning inside)
3. Investment Readiness (several hundred to whatever it takes)
4. Pain Type (replay loop / sabotage / burnout / split self)

Output: Personalized result page with recommended starting lesson.

Headline: "Your AIs are ready. But first: a time-sensitive invitation."

>
> That's what the Small Group Coaching Cohort is for.

## KEY DECISIONS

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Funnel Type | Medium (Advertorial → PDP) | Score of 44 suggests need for warm-up but not full webinar |
| Lead Magnet | Quiz preferred over PDF | Interactive, collects data, provides personalized result |
| Tripwire Price | $97 | Impulse range, high perceived value vs $2,000 tech |
| Main Offer | $3,975 coaching | High LTV justifies ad spend |
| Urgency Mechanism | Jan 1 price increase | Real deadline, not fake scarcity |
| VSL Length | 8-12 minutes | Medium funnel = medium VSL, not 45-min webinar |

---

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY

1. **Quiz Funnel Build** (highest leverage)
   - 4 diagnostic questions from product architecture
   - 4 result pages (one per pain type)
   - Each result page → $97 sales page

2. **Advertorial Creation** (traffic driver)
   - 5 advertorials in task queue
   - Start with "Split Self" and "Replay Loop" angles

3. **Email Sequence** (conversion optimization)
   - 7-email nurture for $97 buyers
   - Bridge to $3,975 coaching

4. **Thank You Page Bridge** (immediate upsell)
   - Already written in sales page
   - Implement as separate page

## COPY RULES (Applied Throughout)

From product architecture:
- Never say "no fluff" (defensive cliche)
- Never say "bundle" (cheap/gimmicky)
- Eliminate em-dashes (use periods, colons, line breaks)
- Architecture/engineering frame, not feelings frame
- Specific numbers where possible
