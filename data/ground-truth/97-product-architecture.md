# $97 Product Architecture - AI De-Risking System

Source: /Volumes/Asylum/dev/email-sequence/analyze this website and break down the functional.txt

## Three-Layer De-Risking Architecture

### Layer 1: Front-End Diagnostic (Inner Architect Guide)
AI system that asks questions and routes to correct slice of curriculum.
Purpose: Removes Decision Paralysis. Instead of 9 lessons, they get: Your specific problem is X, so start with Lesson 3.

### Layer 2: 9 Lesson-Specific AI Systems
One AI per lesson, trained on that lesson content + specific obstacle matrix.
Purpose: Personalizes Experience. Each lesson AI knows 3 actions, 3 predictable obstacles per action, pre-written responses.

### Layer 3: Obstacle Matrix Mini-App
Interactive guide showing: If you hit obstacle X while doing Action 2 of Lesson 5, here is exact intervention.
Purpose: Maximum De-Risking. They never feel lost. System says: We predicted this. Here is the solution.

## Diagnostic Questions Structure

### Layer 1: Wealth/Readiness Signal (3 questions)

Q1 - Role Signal:
- A) Solo entrepreneur/freelancer
- B) Leadership/management role (SWEET SPOT)
- C) Employee contributor
- D) Between roles/transitioning

Q2 - Pain Sophistication Signal:
- A) Anxious/stressed but functioning (low signal)
- B) High-performing outside, burning out internally (YOUR PEOPLE)
- C) Massive goals, keep sabotaging at last moment (YOUR PEOPLE)
- D) Successful but hollow (PREMIUM BUYER)

Q3 - Investment Readiness Signal:
- A) Free or cheap (<$100)
- B) Several hundred dollars
- C) $1-3k to solve permanently
- D) Whatever it takes (COACHING BUYER)

### Layer 2: Lesson Router (2-3 questions)

Q4 - Pain Type Signal:
- A) Replay conversations obsessively → Lesson 3 (Replay Loop Breaker)
- B) Sabotage when close to achieving → Lesson 4 (Conviction Gauntlet)
- C) Exhausted trying to be perfect → Lesson 7 (Habit Harmonizer)
- D) Two separate lives, authentic vs performed → Lesson 1 (Breakthrough Mapping)

## Output: Personalized Protocol Document

YOUR IMMEDIATE PAIN: [Replay Loop / Sabotage / Burnout / Split Self]
START HERE: Lesson 3 - The Replay Loop Breaker
THEN MOVE TO: Lesson 1 - Breakthrough Mapping
FINALLY BUILD: Lesson 7 - Habit Harmonizer

## Access Level Decision

Give them ALL 9 Lesson AIs plus Diagnostic plus Obstacle Matrix.

Why:
1. Irresistible Value: $97 looks like $2,000 worth of tech
2. Complexity Gap: They see full scope (9 Lessons, 27 Actions, 81 Obstacles). Analytical brain: This is robust... but also A LOT to implement alone.

## Jan 1 Price Hike Integration

Thank You Page Bridge:
Headline: Your AIs are ready. But first - a time-sensitive invitation.

Script: You now own the complete IAS AI Suite. You can implement solo. However, our Small Group Coaching Cohort is open now. On January 1, the price increases to $5,475. Since you are already an Architect, I want to offer priority access to lock in $3,975 before the increase.

## Copy Rules
- Never say "no fluff" (defensive cliche)
- Never say "bundle" (cheap/gimmicky connotation)
- Eliminate em-dashes (breaks rhythm for analytical minds)
- Use periods, colons, or line breaks instead
