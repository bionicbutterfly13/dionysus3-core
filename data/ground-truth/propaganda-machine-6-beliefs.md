## The Two Identities

### Before Identity (Undesired)

- What is the name?
- What results are they getting that they do not want?
- What are they complaining about?
- What old methods are they trying that do not work?
- Undesired feelings?
- Undesired attributes?

### After Identity (Desired)

## The 6 Core Beliefs to Shift

### 1. CORE BELIEF (Big Domino Statement)
Old: Fastest way to get big goal is by [current method]
New: Fastest way to get big goal is by [your new method]

If you can make them believe the only/best way to get [big goal] is by [new method] and the only place to get [new method] is in [program name], then all objections become irrelevant.

### 2. REAL PROBLEM BELIEF
Old: The problem is [what they think it is]
New: The real problem is [what it actually is]

They believe problem is one thing. Real problem is something else. Surface vs root cause.

### 3. TIME BELIEF
Old: Now is not the right time / I do not have time
New: This is the most important thing to spend time on right now

Handles: I do not have time, now is not the right time objection.

### 4. MONEY BELIEF
Old: My money is best spent on [other things]
New: My money is best spent on [your solution]

Handles: I do not have the money, this is not a good use of money objection.

### 5. METHOD BELIEF
Old: [Old method] is the best way to get [big goal]
New: [New method] is the best way to get [big goal]

Handles: I already know this, I can do it myself objection.

### 6. HELP BELIEF
Old: Doing this on my own or with somebody else is the best path
New: Getting help from [you] following [your strategy] is the best path

Handles: Why you vs competitors objection.

4. The Truth - New belief statement
5. What Life Looks Like with New Belief - Vivid description (Heaven Island)
6. Authority Quote - Trusted person who backs up new belief
7. Universal Analogy - Story/parable that reinforces belief

## Cognitive Dissonance Gap

Picture this. Imagine that. What that is: Cognitive dissonance. Separating future them from today them. Creating gap which creates tension. Only way to fill gap is to buy.

## Content Distribution

Every objection you get while doing calls: Make piece of content that undeniably shifts that belief. Hammer it in front of all prospects forever. If not good enough, make another one. Keep adding.

## Be The Client You Want To Attract

How you show up for others is how others will show up for you. If you want clients who pay in full and do what you tell them, you need to do those things yourself.
