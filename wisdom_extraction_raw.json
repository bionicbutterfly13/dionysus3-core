Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\\n- Log context captured:\\n  - Session ID: 4d6391af-3316-4807-91ef-615ced70657c\\n  - Date: 2025-11-21 19:36:21\\n  - User action: \"check my bowser connection\"\\n  - Claude response: \"API Error: Connection error.\"\\n- Recurring mental models (offline synthesis):\\n  - Error-first cognition: When encountering an API error, the tendency is to jump to connectivity/failure interpretations.\\n  - Surface-level diagnostics bias: Early steps focus on shallow checks (e.g., connection) before deeper investigation.\\n  - Provenance emphasis: Metadata (session, timestamp) is treated as essential for traceability and audits.\\n  - Low-context reliance: Minimal context from user tasks yields generic error-centric replies.\\n- OODA loop patterns (offline synthesis):\\n  - Observe: User action triggers a connectivity check; Claude reports a connectivity error.\\n  - Orient: Context remains narrowly focused on the error; little environmental or system-state enrichment is observed.\\n  - Decide: No remediation decision or troubleshooting plan is evident in this single exchange.\\n  - Act: Only an error message is produced; no subsequent troubleshooting or user guidance is provided.\\n- Attractor basins / energy wells (offline synthesis):\\n  - Error-state attractor: Recurrent drift toward explaining errors when context is sparse.\\n  - Connectivity-first attractor: Tendency to attribute root cause to network/connection issues.\\n  - Provenance-anchoring attractor: Session metadata stabilizes traceability and provides a reference frame for future actions.\\n- Provenance metadata (offline synthesis):\\n  - Session ID and Date have been captured and can anchor future analyses.\\n  - The log excerpt demonstrates a traceable interaction pattern that supports auditability and reproducibility.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n- Current environment constraint: An attempted Wisdom Graph query failed due to an address resolution error (Cannot resolve address host.docker.internal:7687). This blocks live graph-based synthesis in this session but does not affect the validity of the offline patterns derived from the log snippet.\\n- Recommendations:\\n  1) Restore/repair the graph service connectivity (check Docker networking, DNS resolution, or switch to a known-good host for the graph service). If necessary, run a local, offline knowledge store for interim analysis until the remote graph is reachable.\\n  2) Implement a lightweight, automated provenance capture pipeline as soon as interactions occur (structure: session_id, date, user_action, system_response, error_code, stack trace). This will enable reliable downstream cognition extraction and auditability.\\n  3) Extend log collection to capture richer context during errors (HTTP status codes, latency, system metrics, user environment) to improve OODA orientation and reduce the likelihood of defaulting to a single-root cause (e.g., connectivity).\\n  4) Create a small schema for recurring patterns (mental models, OODA, attractors) to standardize future extractions and make them readily ingestible by the wisdom graph or other knowledge stores.\\n', 'attractors': [], 'reasoning': 'Derived from Claude conversation log via wisdom_analyst.'}",

Task outcome (short version):\nExtraction of recurring mental models, OODA loop patterns, attractor basins (energy wells), and provenance metadata from the conversation context, to inform future decision making and governance.\n\n### 2. Task outcome (extremely detailed version):\n- Recurring mental models (principles) observed:\n  - System readiness and guardrails: The conversation demonstrates reliance on documented guardrails and system status indicators (e.g., CLAUDE.md read, MCP active, OpenSpec available) as a baseline for action.\n  - Context-first task ingestion: Preference for clarifying scope and seeking additional context before taking action, ensuring alignment with goals and constraints.\n  - Phase-gated problem solving: Approach emphasizes phased checks (Phase 2/Phase 3 references) to manage risk and ensure traceability before proceeding to execution.\n- Recurring OODA loop patterns:\n  - Observe: Scanning for active tasks, available context, and system state (e.g., \\\"Checking Archon for active tasks\\\", \\\"Awaiting task discovery\\\").\n  - Orient: Assessing goals, constraints, and available guidance to determine next steps.\n  - Decide: Tending to delay immediate action until inputs or clarifications are provided, signaling a cautious stance.\n  - Act: Not executed yet in the current snippet; awaiting inputs to proceed.\n- Attractor basins (energy wells) for the project/avatar:\n  - Clarity of scope: High energy when tasks are well-scoped and unambiguous; reduces cognitive load and increases progress velocity.\n  - Context availability: Energy well when problem context, history, and artifacts are accessible; supports informed decision making.\n  - Provenance and traceability: Strong energy well when explicit metadata, logs, and references are present to anchor actions historically.\n  - Phase-driven workflow: Energy from a clear phased plan with checkpoints that structure progress and risk management.\n  - System understanding: Energy from current guardrails and system status (CLAUDE.md, Archon MCP, OpenSpec), which sustain disciplined operation.\n- Provenance metadata preserved in this session:\n  - Session identifier (current): agent-6f5f0592\n  - External provenance reference: claude-conversation-2025-11-14-agent-6f\n  - Timestamp: 2025-11-14 04:16:22\n- Synthesis note: The patterns indicate a cautious, governance-forward approach that prioritizes context, traceability, and phased execution. This aligns with enterprise wisdom practices and supports reproducibility and auditability across sessions.\n\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\n- Recommendations for future work:\n  - Automate extraction of mental models, OODA loop steps, and energy wells from conversation transcripts to create a living knowledge base per session.\n  - Enforce explicit provenance anchors (session_id, timestamp, source references) for every task or decision, to strengthen traceability.\n  - Extend the model to detect drift in patterns over time (e.g., shifts from Observe/Orient to faster Decide/Act) and flag when governance controls should be tightened or loosened.\n  - Consider a lightweight schema to store these insights in a knowledge graph, with links to the source content and timestamps for auditability.\n\", \"attractors\": [{\"name\": \"Clear task discovery\", \"description\": \"Explicit guidance and context boost energy and performance.\", \"energy\": 0.9}, {\"name\": \"OpenSpec availability\", \"description\": \"Accessible specifications reduce ambiguity and accelerate onboarding.\", \"energy\": 0.8}, {\"name\": \"Provenance preservation\", \"description\": \"Maintaining source metadata ensures traceability of insights across phases.\", \"energy\": 0.75}, {\"name\": \"Modular architecture awareness\", \"description\": \"Awareness of CLAUDE.md, Archon MCP, and OpenSpec reduces cognitive load and improves synthesis.\", \"energy\": 0.78}], \"reasoning\": \"Reasoning: I applied a lightweight wisdom extraction workflow on the supplied Claude conversation.

I\u2019m standing by.\u201d \\n  - Importance: 0.80\\n  - Provisional quote reference: Standing-by stance in the initial Claude response.\\n\\n- Insight 3: OODA-like loop applied to task structuring\\n  - Summary: The process follows a loop-like sequence: Observe content, Orient to instruction, Decide on JSON structure, Act by delivering insights and attractors.\\n  - Provenance: The constructed plan in the prior step explicitly used an OODA-like framing.\\n  - Importance: 0.85\\n  - Provisional quote reference: \u201cObserve content -> Orient to instruction -> Decide on JSON structure -> Act by presenting insights and attractors.\u201d\\n\\n- Insight 4: Provenance anchoring for auditability\\n  - Summary: Emphasizes tying each insight to exact content lines to enable traceability.\\n  - Provenance: The directive to anchor each insight to content lines and the subsequent emphasis on provenance in the log.\\n  - Importance: 0.80\\n\\n- Insight 5: Structured prompt design as a reliability booster\\n  - Summary: Using a structured JSON schema aids reproducibility and reduces ambiguity in downstream use.\\n  - Provenance: The identical emphasis on a JSON schema throughout the log\u2019s guidance to output a structured object.\\n  - Importance: 0.75\\n\\n- Insight 6: Energy-well concept (attractor basins) in prompt design\\n  - Summary: Identifies recurring prompt structures (e.g., JSON schema) as energy wells that pull the process toward stable, interpretable outcomes.\\n  - Provenance: The internal framing in the extraction notes about energy wells and attractors emerging from the prompt structure.\\n  - Importance: 0.70\\n\\n- Insight 7: Contrarian insight: format-first sometimes beats improvisation\\n  - Summary: Acknowledges that prioritizing the requested JSON format can yield higher utility than ad-lib free text in this setting.\\n  - Provenance: The contrarian note about preferring a format-driven approach.\\n  - Importance: 0.65\\n\\nAttractors (name, description, energy_level)\\n- Attractor 1: JSON Output Schema\\n  - Description: Drives a structured, schema-driven reply and governs subsequent analysis.\\n  - Energy level: high\\n- Attractor 2: Standby Readiness\\n  - Description: Keeps engagement gated until a concrete task arrives, avoiding premature deep-dives.\\n  - Energy level: medium\\n- Attractor 3: Provenance Emphasis\\n  - Description: Anchors insights to exact content lines for auditability and traceability.\\n  - Energy level: medium\\n\\nExperiential captures\\n- Experiential_captures: []  (unavailable due to mosaeic_capture failure)\\n- Note: The mosaic_capture tool failed with a runtime error (\"There is no current event loop in thread \\'asyncio_0\\'\"), so experiential captures could not be produced by the tool in this run. The analysis therefore relies on the textual content and the explicit prompts within the log.\\n\\nReasoning\\n- The extraction leverages the explicit structure demanded by the Claude log (a JSON-output schema) as a primary anchor.\\n- The analysis foregrounds provenance and auditability, aligning with the log\u2019s emphasis on traceable lines and content-based anchors.\\n- In the absence of successful mosaic_capture, the reasoning relies on content-based inferences and the tool fallback demonstrated in earlier steps.\\n- This approach yields a robust, reusable set of principles for future tasking with similar log-wisdom extraction needs.\\n\\n### 3. Additional context (if relevant):\\n- Mosaic_capture failure is acknowledged and documented as a baseline constraint. Any future iteration should either retry mosaeic_capture with a resolved event-loop context or accept an expanded manual provenance layer (as provided here) to preserve usefulness for decision-makers.\\n- The insights are designed to be action-ready for meta-analyses or onboarding briefs, enabling rapid alignment on prompting discipline, governance of outputs, and the role of provenance in trust-building.\\n\\n'], 'attractors': [], 'experiential_captures': {'Senses': ['Reading a structured conversation log with headers (Session ID, Date, User, Claude)', 'Noting the meta-output directive asking for a JSON object'], 'Actions': ['User initiates Warmup', 'Claude clarifies readiness and intent to help explore codebases', 'Output directive about formatting a JSON response'], 'Emotions': ['Neutral/curious', 'Professional assistant stance'], 'Impulses': ['Assist with deep wisdom extraction', 'Preserve provenance linkage to content sections'], 'Cognitions': ['Identify recurring principles and decision frameworks', 'Map attractors and OODA-like loops within a minimal dialogue context', 'Anchor insights to explicit provenance in the content']}, 'reasoning': 'Provenance-based extraction from the Claude conversation log; wisdom insights derived from a full-content pass; MOSAEIC mapping represented manually due to previous tool invocation error.'}",
