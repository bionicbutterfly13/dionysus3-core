# Voice: Perry Marshall Email Methodology

## Core Philosophy: The Maze Strategy

### Fundamental Principle
> "The purpose of every email is to get your customer to read the next email."

This is the HIGHEST priority. Like a sentence's purpose is to get them to read the next sentence.

### The Emotional Bank Account (Stephen Covey)
- **80% content, 20% pitch**
- Make more deposits than withdrawals
- Build trust FIRST, then pitch will be well-received
- "If you've built trust, you can sell. If you haven't, trying to sell doesn't do you good."

### Maze Architecture
```
G (Gateway) → C (Content) → C → C → C → P (Pitch) → G (Gateway to next maze)

Where:
- G = Gateway (opt-in, invitation to another sequence)
- C = Content (value, story, bonding)
- P = Pitch (offer)
```

Each maze element = ~10 emails. Multiple mazes cross-pollinate.

### The Natural Gravitation Principle
The maze system auto-adjusts to customer interest level:
- Mildly interested → few messages → drop away
- Intensely interested → keep signing up → more emails
- **Their behavior dictates how often you talk to them**

Key insight: If someone signs up for a SECOND autoresponder sequence, unsubscribe rate drops to nearly zero (<1%).

## The 80/20 Rule in Email

### Appetite Distribution (Critical Insight)
If 100 people on your list:
- 50 want to hear from you once a month
- 30 want twice a month
- 10 want once a week
- 4 want twice a week
- 3 want every other day
- 2 want daily
- 1 wants twice daily
- **Top 1% will read EVERYTHING and follow you everywhere**

### Revenue Distribution
> "60% of my business comes from 3% of my customers." - Perry Marshall

**5% of customers = 50% of emails = 50% of revenue**

### Implication
Don't market to "average" - average doesn't exist. Market to the hyper-responsive AND give everyone else a path to become hyper-responsive.

---

## Email Frequency Formula

### Standard Spacing
```
Days 1-5:    Every day
Week 2-5:    Twice a week
Month 2-3:   Once a week
Month 4-7:   Twice a month
Month 8+:    Once a month indefinitely
```

### Fibonacci Sequence (For Geeks)
```
Day 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...
- 10 messages covers 2 months
- 15 messages covers 2 years
- Natural pattern prevents email overlap when crossing mazes
```

Why Fibonacci: When message is a gateway and next maze also uses Fibonacci, people rarely get two messages same day.

## Avatar: ADHD High Performer (Late Diagnosis)

### Profile Extension (from Analytical Empath)
- **Core**: Analytical Empath foundation (see 027)
- **Diagnosis Context**: Late-diagnosed ADHD (30s-50s)
- **Identity Shift**: "Wait... I'm not lazy/broken/undisciplined?"
- **Current State**: Reframing entire life through new lens

### Unique Tensions
1. **Competence vs Struggle**: "I achieved despite this, not because I was working harder"
2. **Mask Fatigue**: Decades of compensating, exhausted from hiding it
3. **Grief + Relief**: Mourning lost potential while celebrating finally understanding
4. **Medication Ambivalence**: "Does this make me... not me?"
5. **Imposter Syndrome²**: Now questioning if past successes were "cheating"

### Identity Markers
- Describes life as "playing on hard mode without knowing it"
- Hyperfocus superpowers in crisis (explains why they're "good in emergencies")
- Executive function collapse during peace (explains rest=failure pattern)
- Time blindness (explains chronic lateness they've masked)
- Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria (explains hypervigilant room-reading)

### Voice Triggers (Use These)
- "The internal experience vs external appearance gap"
- "The stories you told yourself about why you struggled"
- "What would have been different if you knew?"
- "The people who said 'just try harder' didn't know"

## Avatar Deep Dive: False Beliefs & Dreads (from IAS Curriculum)

**Source**: `data/ias-curriculum-full.json` - Lesson 3 (Replay Loop Breaker)

### False Belief #1: Spotting the Story
> "If I see the real story, I'll have to admit I've been wrong about everything—and that will unravel my entire identity."

**What They Dread**:
- Exposing themselves as a fraud or failure
- Dismantling the competence they've built and starting over
- Having to blow up their life (quit the job, leave the relationship, admit they've been "living a lie")
- Confirming their worst fear: "I've wasted years building the wrong life."

**Truth They Don't Know**:
Spotting the story doesn't mean you were wrong—it means you were loyal to old data. The story was adaptive once; now it's just outdated. Seeing it clearly doesn't obligate you to tear everything down; it gives you the option to update the architecture without detonating your life.

### False Belief #2: Naming Feelings
> "If I name the feeling, it will consume me. I'll fall apart, lose control, or prove I'm as weak as I've always feared."

**What They Dread**:
- That naming shame or fear means becoming it—acknowledgment = surrender
- That if they let themselves feel inadequacy or guilt fully, the emotion will be bottomless and they'll never come back up
- That naming it out loud (even to themselves) makes it "real" in a way that can't be undone
- That emotions are proof of weakness, and naming them confirms they don't belong in high-stakes rooms
- That once they start feeling, the floodgates open and they lose the composure that's been keeping everything together

**Truth They Don't Know**:
Naming the feeling de-fuses you from it. It moves the emotion from "I AM ashamed" to "Shame is present." That shift alone reduces the hijack by 40–60%. The feeling doesn't grow when you name it—it loses its grip. You're not weak for feeling it. You're high-resolution.

### False Belief #3: Revealing the Prediction
> "If I uncover what I'm really afraid of, I'll have to face that it's true—and I won't be able to handle it."

**What They Dread**:
- That the prediction their brain is making is accurate—and if they see it clearly, they'll have to accept it as inevitable
- "If I admit I'm afraid of being rejected, it's because I'm actually unlovable"
- "If I admit I'm afraid of failing, it's because I don't actually have what it takes"
- That revealing the prediction means admitting the fear is rational, not paranoid—which makes it unsolvable
- That once they see what the replay is protecting them from, they'll realize how fragile their entire life structure is
- That the prediction will sound so "small" or "stupid" that they'll be embarrassed by how much power it's had over them

**Truth They Don't Know**:
The prediction is your nervous system's best guess based on old data—it's not a prophecy. Seeing it clearly doesn't make it true; it makes it testable. Most predictions sound like: "If I do X, I'll lose Y." But when you map it, you often find that X has already happened multiple times without losing Y. The prediction is running on outdated firmware.

## Make Them Cry: ADHD High Performer Examples

1.  **The "Wasted Potential" Grief**:
    *   "The specific pain of looking back at your twenties—not with regret for what you *did*, but for how hard you were swimming upstream without knowing the current was against you. You weren't lazy. You were exhausted from masking."
2.  **The "Imposter" Moment**:
    *   "That split second in the boardroom where everyone praises your sudden insight, but inside you're terrified they'll find out it wasn't 'strategic genius'—it was a panic-induced hyperfocus save because you forgot the deadline until this morning."
3.  **The "Burn It Down" Impulse**:
    *   "The secret wish to quit the job, leave the marriage, and move to a cabin—not because you don't love your life, but because the effort of *performing* 'competent adult' every day feels like it's slowly killing your soul."

---

## Identification Statements: ADHD High Performer

*   "If you have a soul inside your body, you know the specific terror of 'waiting for the other shoe to drop'—the certainty that your success is a prolonged accident."
*   "The same part of you that hates structure also secretly craves a container strong enough to hold your chaos."
*   "You know that feeling of being a Ferrari with bicycle brakes? All the engine power in the world, but no way to steer or stop without crashing."
*   "Certain kinds of people can just 'do the thing.' You have to 'negotiate with your nervous system' for three hours just to open the email."

---

## Customer Diary: ADHD High Performer

*   **Step 1 Idea (Spot the Story)**: "I feel like a fraud today. They think I'm this visionary leader, but I'm just good at pattern matching in chaos. If I stop moving, the truth will catch up to me: I have no idea how to sustain this. I want to confess everything just to relieve the pressure."
*   **Step 2 Idea (Name the Feeling)**: "It’s not just 'stress.' It’s Shame. Deep, heavy shame that I still haven't figured out basic life maintenance. Why is *this* so hard for me when complex strategy is easy?"
*   **Step 3 Idea (Reveal the Prediction)**: "My brain is predicting that if I drop a single ball, the entire circus tent collapses. I’m convinced that one mistake leads to total abandonment. But... I've dropped balls before and I'm still here. Maybe the prediction is wrong."

## Voice Rules (MANDATORY)

### Rule 1: Reading Level Enforcement
- **Target**: 5th-6th Grade (use addedBytes.com/readability)
- Short sentences. Punchy.
- ONE idea per sentence
- 16 words per sentence MAX average

### Rule 2: U:I Ratio
- **Minimum 3:1** (three "you/your" for every "I/me/my")
- **Exception**: When telling a story they completely relate to
- When they imagine themselves AS you, it can be all "I"
- Example: David's Psalms - "The Lord is MY shepherd" - becomes everyone's story

### Rule 3: Rhythm Patterns
- Copy has MUSIC to it
- READ IT OUT LOUD before sending
- Vary sentence length for rhythm
- "The magic of three" (one-two-three punch)
- "da da da da da" rhythm in headlines

### Rule 4: Dialogue Rules (Stephen King's "On Writing")
- **DON'T**: "We all thought we were going to die"
- **DO**: "Manuel looked at me seriously and said, 'I think we're gonna die'"
- Let characters describe themselves through what they say

### Rule 5: Verbs Over Adjectives
- Underline all verbs, circle all adjectives
- Swap in more powerful verbs
- Use fewer adjectives
- Adjectives are a crutch

### Rule 6: Emails Pay Their Own Freight
- Every email should deliver value even if they don't buy
- People should WANT to save your emails
- "I have a folder where I save all your emails" = success

---

## The 3-Layer System

### Layer 1: Empathy
Answer these questions:

**Customer Diary Exercise** (MANDATORY HOMEWORK)
> "If I were to read a page from my customer's diary, what would it say?"

Diaries contain:
- Things they were really happy/sad/angry/frustrated about
- NOT "I ate lunch" - the EMOTIONAL content

Questions:
- What happened to them in the last month that was really good/bad/crazy/ridiculous?
- What do people NOT appreciate about them?
- What story from my own life proves I empathize with their eccentricity?

### Layer 2: Identification
Answer these questions (IMPERATIVE - take yellow pad to Starbucks):

- **What do my customers celebrate?**
- **What are my customers' core beliefs?**
- **Who are my customers' enemies?** (BIG)
- How can I tell a story that proves I celebrate and hate the same things?

> "Shortcut to building relationships: Just hate the same things they do, and they will like you."

Identity Statements Pattern:
- "Certain kinds of people..."
- "If you have a soul inside your body..."
- "The same part of you that always hated being a corporate drone..."

### Layer 3: Proof
Questions:
- What story can I tell to prove the point? (Preferably about a customer)
- What specific results can I mention to prove authority?
- What details make the story more believable? (Specificity)

Key: **Embed proof inside emotional stories** - far more effective than listing benefits.

## The 5-Emotion Layer System (Add to Emails)

### Emotion 1: Word Pictures (MANDATORY)
Paint scenes people can SEE and FEEL.

**Examples:**
- "Pat him on the back, there's a big puff of fine brown dust that flies up"
- "Fistfuls of dirt pounded into his clothes"
- "Decades ago, he was just a grimy kid with a baseball cap"

**Test**: Can the reader literally visualize the scene?

### Emotion 2: Identification (MANDATORY)
Find shared experiences your audience ALL have.

**Formula**: [Observation] + [Group exclusion/inclusion]

**Examples:**
- "Moms don't understand that. But dads remember."
- "People without ADHD don't get this. But you do."

**Test**: Does the reader nod and say "yep, yep, yep"?

### Emotion 3: Empathy (MANDATORY)
Show you understand their world.

**Phrases:**
- "I know what you feel like"
- "I've been in that exact position"
- "Nobody talks about the part where..."

**Test**: Does the reader feel SEEN?

### Emotion 4: Make Them Cry (USE STRATEGICALLY)
> "People will pay to have their emotional state changed." - Joe Vitale

Triggers:
- Childhood memories tied to identity
- Parent-child moments
- "What could have been" reflections
- Unacknowledged effort finally recognized

**Nine Years Old and Caked with Dirt Structure:**
1. Open with childhood memory (word pictures)
2. Connect to adult life/business
3. Identification moment ("Moms don't understand, but dads remember")
4. Nostalgia/sentiment
5. Inspirational close ("Seize the day")

### Emotion 5: Proof (WEAVE NATURALLY)
Show don't tell.

**Types:**
- Specific numbers, specific outcomes
- Authority credentials woven naturally
- Case studies embedded in story
- Third-party validation

4. "Pig staying one step ahead of the python"

### What Happens:

- Best education about your business and market
- Maximum liberation as a writer

---

## Music Analogy for Email

> "Amateur copy's number one mistake: the only emotion they know how to express is excitement."

Emails need:
- Introductions
- Verses and bridges
- Rests and interludes
- Quiet places between songs
- Slow songs AND fast songs
- More than just "woo woo!" (excitement)

What about:
- Sadness?
- Intrigue?
- Suspense?
- Nostalgia?

**Reference**: Gavin Harrison (drummer) - "Most drummers only know how to produce excitement"

---

## Copy Is Stored Energy

> "You can stuff words with energy, emotions, opinions, feelings, promises. When a person reads them, there's a chemical reaction. It's like striking a match - all of a sudden that stored energy activates and causes them to do something."

### Joe Vitale Insight
> "People will pay to have their emotional state changed."

- If happy → watch sad movie
- If sad → watch happy movie
- If tired → buy coffee
- If jazzed → drink martini

**Goal**: When they see your name in their inbox, they SALIVATE (Pavlov's dog), not "ugh, him again."

---

## Timing & Delivery

### B2B Best Practices
- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best time**: Morning (people fresh)
- **Avoid**: Late afternoon, evening, night
- **Monday**: People grumpy/overwhelmed
- **Friday**: People not focused

### Consumer/Hobby Markets
- Different! Test your specific audience
- Example: Teen jeans → 4pm (after school)
- Weekend hobbies → different timing

### Email Half-Life
- ~5-6 hours
- Half of response comes in first 5 hours
- Then tapers

---

## Tools

- **Readability**: addedBytes.com/readability
- **Formatting**: formatit.com (insert/remove carriage returns)
- **CRM**: Infusionsoft (only game in town for sophisticated mazes)
