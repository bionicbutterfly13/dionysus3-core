 3 What O thers Are S aying About John Mulry  
 
Working with John and his agency has been nothing short of phenomenal. Not only does he have the exceptional ability to understand our needs, but his 
remarkable availability in every interaction truly sets him apart. We were facing 
significant challenges.  Our customer and lead acquisition costs had skyrocketed.  
The market we operate in is small and difficult to target.  We tried various 
strategies and worked with different media buyers to address the issue, but the results were less than encouraging.  That’s when I first reached out to John.  His 
strategy completely outsmarted everything we had tried before.  Now, our 
campaign economics are perfectly aligned with our goals, and we’ve just wrapped up one of the best semesters in our history.  - Andre Grassi  
 John and the E5 team worked closely with us to create an ad strategy for some frontend acquisition campaigns. What makes John and the team unique is their vast experience in direct response marketing which means they see an ad campaign as part of the whole  marketing picture . That means they go above and 
beyond just what is strictly in the ads - to make campaigns effective.  – 
Kennedy, Email Marketing Heroes  John is a scientist when it comes to scaling ads. Meticulous, methodical, and unrelenting with testing, he gets the right message in front of the right people for the best results.  – Kyle Milligan , Copysquad  
 John and I hopped on a quick call to just go over some of our YouTube ads. He spotted about four things that we were doing wrong inside of our campaign to instantly get a boost in conversions. If you ever get a chance to hop on a call with John, dude knows  his stuff.

 4 He knows everything there is about Facebook ads, YouTube ads, Google ads. 
He's an absolute rock star. We're using him inside of our business as a 
consultant, and if anyone's considering working with John, I give him my full stamp of approval. John, appreci ate you, man. You're a beast. Thanks for 
everything you do.  – Joel Erway , The Webinar Agency  
 John’s  a guy with lots of integrity. He's been working with me , running ads for 
BNSN.ai. And he's one of the first guys that got ads to actually work well for 
us. We've been scaling, he's great to work with.  John and , his team manage 
everything for us. All I do is just go and see how much money we made that 
day, which is kind of the way I like it, because I suck at that part of the business, and he doesn't. I you're thinking about hiring somebody to do your ads for you, 
placements, Facebook stuff that he's doing for us, he's great at this stuff and highly recommend it.  – Jon Benson , BNSN AI 
 I've known John for about five years, and the one thing that you need to know 
about John is something that's very rare in this industry, which is a marketer 
who really cares. John's not gonna take your money. John's not gonna run a campaign for you unless he knows it's gonna work. In fact, John's gonna be 
brutally honest with you if your campaign isn't gonna work, and then he's gonna work as hard as he can to help you fix it and make it work, because John is not just a media manager.   
 John is a true cutting -edge marketer who has paid his dues, has been in this 
industry for well over a decade, learning from the best of the best, working with the best of the best, honing his skills, and honestly, he's really one of the best marketers that  I know. His ability to implement and execute quickly and rapidly 
and iterate is on par with just a handful of people that I've seen that can perform

 5 at that level. So if you're looking for someone to run your campaigns for you, 
but not only just run traffic, anybody can run traffic to a certain degree, but if 
you want real strategy, if you want somebody who's actually gonna look at your funnel, help yo u optimize it, understand the economics of it, understand the 
metrics of it, make sure everything's being tracked right, working right, fully tested before it goes live, and then constantly working to iterate, scale it, and make it better, there's nobody else in this industry that I could recommend to you more so than John.  – Teddy Garcia , CMO Peter Diamindis 
 Let me start out by saying that John Mu lry is a gem to work with. John worked 
with us and I've known him for many years, to help us run our ads for Best Seller Publishing . Ads for our book funnels, webinar funnels, automated 
funnels, application funnels.  And John always bent over backwards to ensure 
our funnel success from checking out my copy to writing copy for us, changing video scripts, audio scripts. John, I love working with you. I love the work ethic you have, the creativity that you have.  You have d one a fantastic job for me and 
for Best Seller Publishing. And I just want to say thank you.  
– Rob Kosberg, Bestseller Publishing  
 I publish financial newsletters and coaching for stocks and options traders. Probably one of the hardest and most competitive industries to get profitable, so I just wanted to give a big shout -out to John Mulry and the E5 agency.  
We've been working together now for, gosh, going on two and a half years, and I just could not be happier. John is so much more than just a person hitting the buttons behind your Facebook or your YouTube account. John is actually a marketer who understands  direct response copy, which means that he will get 
the right audience to see your ads and ultimately become a customer.

 6 If you've ever run paid traffic before, you know it can seem like a giant black 
hole and you have no idea where your ad spend is going. Well, that's not the 
way John does things at all at E5. He actually treats my account like it's his own money.  There's no one that I would trust more to run my traffic than John. I couldn't recommend more strongly working with John and the E5 agency as one of the most important long -term decisions that you could make to grow your business.  
– Pete Renzulli, Stock Trading Pro  
 I have been in the world of direct response marketing for close to 20 years and during that time I have had my fair share of experiences with media buyers and agencies. And sadly, most of them were disappointing. And the reason for that is that while most of them have a fundamental understanding of media buying 
or how to run ads, what they lack is a fundamental understanding of direct response marketing.  
 Well, that's what separates John M ulry and the E5 agency from most of the 
other agencies that I've worked with in the past because John not only has a fundamental understanding of direct response marketing, he has an extremely deep level of understanding when it comes to direct response mark eting.  
 In fact, I would argue that he's savvier than most of the gurus teaching internet marketing these days. And so that combination of expert level knowledge when it comes to direct response marketing combined with the latest and greatest tactics and strategie s that are working right now as it pertains to media buying 
is what separates John and enables him to get the results that he's able to get for his clients.

 7 John knows everything there is to know about direct response marketing, copy, 
offers, hooks, language, positioning, you name it, John knows it and 
understands it on a very deep level. And of course, when it comes to media buying, he's an absolute wizard. I  mean, he was able to look at one of our 
campaigns that our so -called expert media buyers set up and John was able to 
identify missteps and holes in that campaign within seconds.  
 And in about a half hours’ time , he was able to fix that campaign and get it to 
where it needed to be to start driving profitable sales. If you are considering 
working with John or the E5 agency, I cannot recommend them highly enough. And I suggest you start working with them as soon as you can.  – Paul 
Mascetta , Influence Academy 
 So thankful for John Mulry. John and  his team have been with us when we were 
doing six figures, and now they're with us when we're doing multiple seven figures, approaching eight figures .  
 They've really been kind of the secret weapon behind the growth that we've had, 
and they've been with us every step of the way. I can't thank him enough.  I 
don't know how he does it. He's always on top of the latest changes and everything, and plus he's just a good guy to work with.  - Jim Baker, Wealth 
With God

 12 About John Mulry  
 
John Mulry is an award -winning, Dan 
Kennedy- trained trusted marketing advisor 
with a unique, deep knowledge that spans 
copywriting, direct response, media buying, 
economics, offer creation, and funnel optimization to name a few.  
 
Originally coming from a finance background with degrees in 
mathematics, economics and a master’s in finance  and capital markets,  
John fell in love with advertising and marketing when he started his first business, a personal training and fitness business.  
 
After quitting the finance world to volunteer in South America for 
year, John returned home and opened a fitness business only to realize 
if he didn’t get good at marketing and advertising, he’d quickly be out 
of business. A chance encounter led him to discovering Dan Kennedy . 
He implemented and mastered Dan’s ‘Magnetic Marketing’  principles 
to such success he ended up partnering with Dan and GKIC to become 
Dan’s first ever and only business advisor in Ireland.  
 
Transitioning away from fitness to focus solely on his true passion 
of direct response , John ran his own successful copywriting , info 
marketing  and consultancy business for many years before joining 
forces with Todd Brown to be his Director of Marketing in February 2020.  
 
In September 2021 John started Todd's sister business the E5 Agency 
which helps multi -six-figure and seven -figure businesses achieve their 
media buying and traffic conversion goals.

 13 Foreword  
 
I was recently asked this question in our E5 Nation group on Facebook: 
“If you were to start over in business today, what would you do to become a master marketer?”.  
  
The answer I gave wasn't what people were expecting. If I was to start over in business today, I would not strive to become a master marketer at all.   
Instead, I would strive to become a master entrepreneur. I would master entrepreneurial skills. That's because the entrepreneurs with great entrepreneurial skills, but maybe are lacking on the marketing side of things, almost always beat the marketers with  great marketing skills that 
lack entrepreneurial skills.  
  
I've seen so many marketers, so many copywriters, so many experts over the years run businesses into the ground, not because they lack marketing skills or copy skills, but because they lack entrepreneurial skills.   
I've also seen people that didn't have great marketing skills, that didn't put out great marketing campaigns, who have grown large, stable and highly profitable businesses. Why? Because they understood and mastered entrepreneurial skills.  
  
They understand strategy, positioning, leverage and financials. One particular area of their financials they also master and use to their advantage is the economics of customer acquisition and future

 14 monetization. They’re simply playing a different game than everyone 
else. 
  
What John has put together for you in OfferNomics is a roadmap for you to be able to play a different game with your business. A different game with your paid advertising.  
  
Not one of just media performance or just marketing performance, but 
one of economic performance too. Essentially, John is giving you a roadmap to rig the game of paid advertising in your favor.  
  
When we first started the E5 Agency, it was born out of a need in our own business. I think we went through eleven advertising agencies and none of them could beat the results we were getting internally.  
  
John was my Director of Marketing at the time, and we saw a huge gap 
in the marketplace.  With a lot of paid advertising agencies, they’re really 
good at the media side, they’re really good at setting up and running paid advertising campaigns.  
  
But they’re usually lacking when it comes to the marketing performance side of things, and especially the economics side of things.  
  
When things don’t go right, their answer is typically to blame the marketing side with no remedy to fix it, or to look solely through the lens of better ads, or better creative as the solution.  
  

## Page 15

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 15 That’s why I’m so excited to have John running the E5 Agency and so 
excited for you to read this book.  
  
First and foremost, John’s a beast when it comes to marketing 
performance and economic performance. And since launching the E5 Agency I’ve seen him firsthand truly master the media side of things too, getting incredible results for ourselves and our client s. 
  
Now, do me a favor, and don’t just read this book. Read it and put it into action. Or have someone put it into action for you.  
  
When you do, you’ll open a whole new world of customer acquisition for your business.

 16 Introduction  
 
Scaling your business online is getting harder. There is more 
competition than ever before. Your potential customers and clients have 
more choice, and they are most distracted than ever before.  
 
Couple this with rising advertising costs , declining conversion rates  and 
unless you take a different approach you will likely struggle to grow 
your revenues and your profits.  
 
This book outlines the approach you need to take to scale your offers 
with paid advertising, predictably and consistently.  The OfferNomics  
approach. 
 Now, a  pet peeve of mine is content of any kind that’s not actionable , or 
valuable . Whether it’s a book, a video, a presentation, or anything, if it’s 
not actionable I generally don’t want to know about it.  
 I say this for one simple reason.  This book WILL be actionable and 
valuable . You are going to get breakthroughs, a shift in perspective, a 
shift in thinking but more importantly you’re going to get strategies and 
tactics you can implement.  
 
There is something else I will add right up front.   
 
This book is NOT  a book on the “how to”  of setting up advertising 
campaigns or a tutorial on the ad platforms. It was never meant to be 
that.  
 
There are endless resources, videos, articles , and tutorials on the how to 
of setting up campaigns  on Meta, Google, YouTube and more. 
 
The reality is, today, knowing how to setup campaigns, and how to use the platforms is no longer a competitive advantage.  And as you’re about 

## Page 17

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 17 to discover, the biggest opportunity doesn’t necessarily come from 
bringing ad costs down. 
 
The advantage comes from a very strategic approach to  paid advertising 
and in rigging the economics of paid advertising in your favor.  
 
My early mentor Dan Kennedy calls this “money math ”. Dan famously 
once said “he who can spend the most to acquire a customer wins” .  
 
While you may have heard th is phrase before and intuitively 
understand it, very few people understand  the nuances of implementing  
it, so it becomes a reality.  
 That’s what this book is about.  Rigging the economics of paid 
advertising in your favor so you can outsmart, outlast, and outspend 
your competition. 
 
Now,  I understand there will be lots of different types of business 
owners reading this with varying size of businesses from different 
industries and different levels of knowledge when it comes to paid 
advertising, and advertising strategy. 
 So, this book is split into sections with the first section giving a 
foundational  overview of the principles you need to understand to get 
the most out of this book.  
 The seasoned entrepreneurs may skim over this section or jump to other sections but a word of warning.  
 
There’s a saying I often think of when I catch myself thinking “I know 
some of this already” . 
 
Knowing without doing is the same as not knowing.  
 
You may have heard some of what you’re about to read in various forms 
before but unless the implementation of it is an unconscious act, I’d 

## Page 18

John Mulry 
 
 
 18 encourage you not to skip any part of this book and read it cover to 
cover.  
 
With all that, let ’s start and dive in and with one of the foundations of a 
direct response advertising driven business.  
 
  

## Page 19

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 19 The Foundation of Paid Advertising  
 
In this chapter, I want to give you an introduction to the concept of the 
frontend and the backend . These may be terms you’ve heard in the past 
or maybe you are familiar with them, nonetheless, it’s critical you understand them fully.  
 They are at the foundation of building and growing a direct response driven business, a business based on using paid advertising to acquire 
customers.  
 
The frontend is all the marketing and advertising campaigns you have 
that are designed to turn prospects into new buyers, customers, or new clients. 
 
When we talk about a frontend marketing campaign, we're talking about 
a campaign designed to turn cold traffic (prospects) into buyers.  
 
We typically call these frontend acquisition campaigns, and the goal of 
these campaigns is to acquire as many new customers as possible.  
 
The backend  is of course the other side of the equation. The backend  is 
all the marketing and advertising campaigns designed to generate 
additional transactions from existing customers or clients.  
 
It’s all the marketing, messages and offers you put out in front of existing 
buyers, existing clients, and existing customers, so they can spend more 
with you.  
 The frontend and the backend  make up your overall business. Your 
marketing  and advertising activities fall under one of these two 
categories. Either a campaign is a frontend campaign, or a campaign is 
a backend  campaign. 

## Page 20

John Mulry 
 
 
 20  
For the typical entrepreneur, the typical mom and pop business owner 
who doesn't understand or leverage direct response advertising, to 
them, there is no frontend and backend.  
 
They operate in a transactional mindset, meaning they are just trying to 
generate sales. They are there to produce a certain amount of profit.  
 
Let’s say for example they want a 50% margin from every transaction.  
 
Regardless of whether it is from the first transaction with a brand -new 
buyer, or it's the 10th transaction with a loyal customer. There is no 
difference. There is no frontend and backend . 
 
In this book, you're going to learn why  operating with that type of 
mindset stifles growth because you never fully know how much a buyer, 
a client, a customer is worth you.  
 
It also ensures you’ll never know how much you should invest in paid 
traffic to get new customers, new clients, or buyers. It hampers your 
ability to scale effectively and scientifically.  
 
The easiest way I can sum this up is this: 


## Page 21

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 21  
We are really in the customer acquisition and future monetization game.  
 
A proper frontend allows you to acquire the most amount of customers 
you can at a reasonable cost. The frontend for us is the first transaction.  
 
Or if you have a frontend funnel with multiple offers (bumps, upsells, 
downsells), the frontend is the sum of all those transactions.  
 
The backend is all the subsequent transactions after Day 0.  
 
It’s not the other offers in the same funnel, it’s all the future offers your customers are exposed to after the initial offer or funnel.  
 
The backend is where the profit is in your business.  
 
All our acquisition costs, all the costs associated with acquiring a buyer 
are handled on the front end.  
 
This is just the tip of the iceberg on this topic and we’re going to dive 
deeper into this in the coming chapters.   

## Page 22

John Mulry 
 
 
 22 You’re An Investor (Or You Should Be)  
 
As an entrepreneur, you should see yourself as an investor. You're 
investing in the acquisition of assets, just like any other investor is 
investing in the acquisition of assets, whether it be stocks or real estate.  
 
Only in our case, those assets for you are your customers, or your clients.  
And just like any asset, there is a value today and there is a future value.  
Let's say your customers spend on average $100 on the day they become 
a customer. We typically call that day 0.  
 
As you know, the reason why an investor invests in the acquisition of assets is not just because of what they are worth today, but because of what that investor believes that asset is going to be worth in the future.  
 
The future value is all the other transactions your clients, your 
customers, or your buyers invest in with you, after they become a buyer.  
For example, you're acquiring a customer (asset) that spends $100 with 
you on Day 0, and then maybe over the next month, two months, three 
months, whatever it may be, they spend an additional $100 with you.  
 
 


## Page 23

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 23 You're acquiring a customer that's worth $100 today, and they're worth 
an additional $200 to you in the future.  
 
Now, just like investing in general, when it comes to any asset, there's 
not only a value today and a future value, but of course there is a cost. 
There's a cost to acquire the asset.  
 
When a real estate investor is investing in a piece of property, he or she 
knows what the value is today. 
 
There is also a price they must  pay to get that asset.  
 It’s the same for us with paid advertising. If you run paid ads, the costs 
are basically how much it is costing you to acquire a customer.  
 
Using our simplistic example again.  
 
 
 Let’s say it costs you on average $100 to acquire a customer with paid ads on Meta or Google. That customer spends on average $100 so you 
broke even on customer acquisition costs and essentially acquired a 
customer for free.  
 


## Page 24

John Mulry 
 
 
 24 The future value of a customer to you is an additional $ 200 ($300 total) 
which means for every customer you acquire you make an additional 
$200. 
 On day 0 you break even, liquidating your paid media costs acquiring a 
customer for free and will profit on average an additional $ 200 for every 
customer.  
 
Knowing this, what would your paid advertising budget be?  
 
Hopefully it would infinite.  
 This is a simplistic example, but this mindset is at the foundation of 
being able to scale and grow your business with paid advertising.  
 Every customer you acquire has a cost and value today. Your whole 
business is predicated on how well you do at acquiring customers at as 
close to breakeven as possible on Day 0 (the frontend) and how well you 
do at monetizing those customers further in the future (the backend).  
 
The greater the future value, the more money you make, the more profit 
you make, and the easier this game becomes for you.  
 Let’s take a quick checkpoint at this stage. Have a think about and 
answer these questions.  
 
• How much is it costing you to acquire a customer right now?  
 
• How much is that customer spending with you on average on 
Day 0?  
 
• How much is that customer worth to you after 30 days, 60 days, 90 days etc. ?

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 25 How Aggressive Are You?  
 
Now you understand the difference between frontend and backend and 
the investors mindset, it’s time to dive deep into one of the most valuable 
determinants of success in paid advertising: your level of acquisition 
aggression.  
 Your level of acquisition aggression (LAA) determines how much you 
are willing to invest to acquire a new buyer. It's the average amount of 
money you are willing to spend, to invest, to generate a new client, or 
new customer .  
 
Sadly, most average entrepreneurs have no clue what they're paying to acquire a new buyers, customers, or clients.  
 
Yet, understanding your LAA, understanding how to calculate it and 
understanding the appropriate level of acquisition aggression for your offers is critical.  
 There are 3 levels of acquisition aggression.  
 
• Level 1: Mom & Pop –  MAAC < AOV 
• Level 2: Break -even –  MAAC = AOV 
• Level 3: Negative Investor –  MAAC > AOV 
 
Let’s break these down.  
 
Level 1 is what we call the Mom- and-Pop level. 
 The Mom-and-Pop Level  is the typical average everyday entrepreneur, 
the owner of your typical brick and mortar business. This entrepreneur will spend only enough to allow for a profit margin on every single sale.  
 They look at it transactionally. 

## Page 26

John Mulry 
 
 
 26 The typical mom and pop entrepreneur wants to generate a certain 
percentage of profit on every sale. Like we discussed, they don't care 
whether that sale is the first sale with a brand -new  buyer or the 10th or 
12th sale with a great customer. They don't care to the mom and pop.  
 
They want a certain profit margin on every transaction. So, they're only 
willing to spend just enough that allows them to get their profit margin.  
 
Then we've got level two.  
 
Level two is what I call breakeven level.  
 This means that you are willing to spend a maximum of what a customer 
is worth today to generate a new customer. Meaning you're willing to 
break even.  
 You're not looking for any profit today on the sale. If an average 
customer spends $100 when they become a new buyer, at break even, you're willing to spend or invest $100 to get those new buyers.  
 
Your bank account is no less today than it was before you acquired the 
customer. Except now you have a new buyer.  
 If you're willing to invest, let's say a thousand dollars and you make 
back a thousand dollars in the form of new buyers. That is break even. 
You are acquiring buyers for free. There is no cost to you.  
 A frontend campaign where you are acquiring buyers at no cost to you 
is the holy grail of direct response marketing.  
  
And I want to be crystal clear here. It’s not an easy thing to do. Can it be 
done? Absolutely.  
 With the right audience, offer, messaging , and economics it can 
absolutely be done.  

## Page 27

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 27 Finally,  we have level three, what I call the Negative Investor level.  
 
This is often referred to as going negative. This is where you spend a 
portion of what the customer or buyer is worth to you over the lifetime 
of doing business with you.  
 Meaning we're not only looking at what a new buyer spends with you the day that they become a buyer, but we're also looking at the future 
value of that buyer.  
 
We’re using a percentage of that future value to buy that new customer.  
 We're buying clients, we're buying customers, we're buying subscribers, 
or whatever you call buyers in your business.  
 
At level three, the investor is willing to go negative on day zero, to get 
that new buyer based on what they know about what that new buyer is going to spend on average over the coming weeks and months.  
 
Those are the three different levels of acquisition aggression.  
 
Now, you might be thinking, which level of acquisition aggression should you aim to operate at?  
 
Before we jump into that I want to cover some terms you need to be 
aware of.  We're going to be using some of these terms to do some 
calculations.  
 
CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)  
 
The first one is CPA or cost per acquisition. This is the average cost to acquire a single new customer.  
 How you calculate CPA is easy.  
 

## Page 28

John Mulry 
 
 
 28 You take the total amount that you've invested into paid advertising, 
and you divide it by the number of new customers generated.  
 
If you spend a $10,000 on a campaign and you generate 100 buyers, your 
average CPA is $100.  
 
Now some of those buyers might have cost you $140, some of them might have cost you $90 but on average you spent $10,000 and generated 
100 buyers, with the average CPA being $200.  
 
MAAC (Maximum Allowable Acquisition Cost)  
 The next term is MAAC which stands for maximum allowable 
acquisition cost. This is the maximum CPA you're willing to invest to 
acquire a single new customer.  
 
This is one of the most valuable metrics numbers when it comes to 
scaling your business with paid advertising.  
 
Now, how you determine your MAAC ultimately determines your level 
of acquisition aggression.  
 
AOV (Average Order Value)  
 
On the other side of the equation, we have the average order value, or 
AOV as we call it.  
 This is the average amount of money a new customer, spends with you 
after going through your frontend campaign.  
 
Important: Let’s say you have a campaign that has multiple offers in it, meaning, it has a core offer, a bump,  or bumps, an upsell and downsells.  
 Some buyers will only buy your core offer, some will buy a combination 
of the offer,  and some will buy everything.  

## Page 29

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 29 With AOV we are looking at the average of what was spent across ALL 
the offers in the one front end funnel. We take the total amount 
generated over a period  and divide it by the total number of buyers.  
 Going back to our simplistic example.  
 You spent $10,000 and generated 100 buyers. Your CPA is $100.  
 
Now let’s say from that campaign you generated $12,000.  
 
In this example your AOV is $10,000 divided by 100 buyers which gives us $100.  
 
When it comes to your level of acquisition aggression:  
 
• Level 1: Mom & Pop –  MAAC < AOV 
• Level 2: Break -even –  MAAC = AOV 
• Level 3: Negative Investor –  MAAC > AOV 
 In the above example, although simplistic, it’s easy to determine that the 
current level of acquisition aggression is Level 2: Breakeven.  
 You spent $10,000, generated 100 new buyers at a cost of $100, and they 
spent on average $100 with you on Day 0.  
 
Your bank account is no better off but your business is much better off because you have 100 new customers you can further monetize in the 
future.  
 
Let’s dive deeper into acquisition aggression with three examples, one 
for each of the levels.  
 Let's assume the frontend (FE) average order value is $250.  And let's say in the back end, the average buyer spends an additional $1500. Now 
imagine these numbers are for the same business, the only difference is 
their level of acquisition aggression.  

## Page 30

John Mulry 
 
 
 30  
This example will perfectly illustrate how the L.A.A. impacts your 
ability to generate buyers and build  a profitable business long term.  
 
 
 
For level 1, let's assume they're only willing to operate at a 50% margin.  
 
Since the frontend AOV is worth $250 to them, they’re only willing to 
spend $125 to acquire a new customer.  
 Let’s say they run ads and acquire 5 buyers at $125 each.  
 
Their total costs are $625 which is 5X$125.  
 
Their total revenue generated on the front end is $1,250 (which is 5X$250).  
 
If we subtract their total cost from their total sales generated, we can see 
they are left with a profit of 50% or $625 ($$1250 -$$625=$625). 
 
That’s their frontend profit.  
 Now as we mentioned, those buyers go on to spend an additional $1500 
on average over the lifetime of being a customer.  
 
So here in Level one, the additional backend revenue is 5X$1500 = 
$7,500.  
 
So, the totals here when we combine the frontend,  and the backend are 
as follows:  


## Page 31

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 31 • Total invested in paid ads: $625  
• Front end revenue: $1250  
• Backend revenue: $7,500  
• Total Revenue: $8,750  
• Total Profit: $8,150  
 
Not bad right?  
 But look at what happens at Level 2: Breakeven FE acquisition.  
 
 
 
At level 2, the entrepreneur is willing to breakeven on their frontend 
revenue so using the same numbers as level 1, they are willing to spend 
up to $250 to acquire a buyer.  
 
Now, let’s say that with a CPA of $250 they can generate 10 buyers.  
 
Those 10 buyers spend on average $250 so they spend $2,500 and 
generated $2,500.  
 
There is no profit on the front end.  
 
But in the backend, those 10 buyers go on to spend on average $1,500 
each which gives a backend profit of $15,000.  
 
At level 2, the entrepreneur was willing to invest double level 1 and 
generated nearly DOUBLE the backend revenue as level 1.  
 
Now let’s look at level 3: the negative investor level.  
 
 


## Page 32

John Mulry 
 
 
 32  
 
Here the entrepreneur is willing to invest up to $375 to acquire a buyer.  
 
Remember the front end AOV is $250 so this means at level three the 
investor is willing to go negative $125 for every buyer they generate.  
 Meaning they are willing to lose $125 for every buyer they get.  
 In this example, let’s say with a CPA of $375 they can acquire 15 new buyers.  
 
• Their total costs on the front are 15X$375=$5625  
 
• Their total revenue on the front is 15X$250=$3,750  
 
• Their frontend profit here is -$1875 meaning they are out of 
pocket $1875.  
 
But look what happens to their backend profitability.  
 
• Those 15 buyers spend an additional $1,500 each on average.  
 
• This is an additional $22,500 in backend revenue.  
 
• Subtracting their out- of-pocket expenses of $1,875 from the front 
gives a total profitability of $20,625  
 
As you can see the results are pretty night and day between the three 
levels of acquisition aggression.  
 


## Page 33

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 33 At level three, even though they weren't profitable on the front, they 
generated more than two times profit of what the level one entrepreneur 
did.  
 This is what really is meant by the popular saying “he who can spend 
the most to acquire a buyer wins”.  
 
So which level should you operate at?  For starters, you never want to 
operate at level one when it comes to frontend customer acquisition.  
 For the most part, the clients we work with when running their paid traffic campaigns and scaling their businesses operate at level 2. This 
allows them to acquire customers at breakeven and further monetize 
them in the backend.  
 
We generally recommend everyone to operate at level 2 when it comes 
to paid advertising.  
 Now, if you have more than one product, have a solid backend, have the 
cash flow, and know how much a buyer is worth to you after 30, 60, 90 
days etc . than maybe you can operate at level 3.  
 
Right, so we covered a lot of numbers here and your brain might be a bit scrambled so let’s end this chapter reiterating the mindset you should 
have when it comes to paid advertising.  
 
You’re an investor. You’re investing in the acquisition of assets. Those assets have a cost today, a value today and future value.  
 
All other things being equal, the entrepreneur who is willing to invest 
the most to get a buyer will win the game because the advantage is massively slanted in their favor.

 34 2 Categories of Marketing Metrics  
 
When most entrepreneurs,  coaches, experts, advertisers, or  experts think 
of direct response advertising, what they think of is the psychology and 
communication. 
 
They understand that we need to know the psychology of the 
marketplace.  
 
What they want, what they feel, what they believe, what they don't want 
etc.  
 And most entrepreneurs would agree communication is all about what we say and how we move the prospect and persuade the prospect to 
respond.  
 
But what most don't understand is arithmetic, math, numbers, data, and how we make decisions based on those things is at the foundation of 
making paid advertising work for your business.  
 
Whether we like it or not, paid advertising comes down to numbers  at 
the end of the day.   
 
Direct response advertising is trackable, quantifiable,  and measurable.  
 
Everything we need to know about campaigns from the financials to 
performance comes from the numbers, or math .  
 
Because of this I want to say something that may or may not offend you.  
 
Unlike branding or institutional advertising, we're not relying on pure 
creativity. We're not operating in the dark, hoping for the best because everything that we're doing is trackable, and is measurable. Everything 

## Page 35

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 35 we do can be and should be measured with a number. And those 
numbers make up the arithmetic side of this business.  
 
We use those numbers to understand what's going on in a campaign, to 
understand what's working, what's not working, what steps need to be 
improved, what or where the constraint is and so on.  
 All our decision -making is based on or driven by numbers, by math.  
 
It’s all based on objective decision -making, not subjective decision 
making.  
 
Subjective is when you're making decisions based on your opinions, 
based on what you think, feel, believe, or even what you like.  
 
Objective decision -making is decision- making based on numbers, based 
on data.  
 Fortunately, we have all the data we need to make spot on decisions.  
 
Now, when it comes to marketing metrics, there are two general 
categories of metrics that we look at.  
 
 
  


## Page 36

John Mulry 
 
 
 36 1. Financial Campaign Metrics.  
 
These are the metrics, the numbers that are linked to the cost and the 
revenue side of a campaign.  
 
We use financial campaign metrics to assess the viability of a campaign.   
 
Financial metrics are the metrics that tell us whether the campaign is 
working from a return -on-investment perspective.  
 
They tell us whether a campaign is viable, meaning whether it is 
profitable for us, whether it's ready to scale or not.  
 
2. Performance Campaign Metrics  
 
These are metrics related to how the campaign is performing, how each 
step or stage in the campaign is performing.  
 
Things like your opt -in page percentage, sales page conversion rate, 
order form completion rate, bump take rate, upsell take rate and so on.  
 We use these metrics to improve the results of a campaign.  
 Performance campaign metrics simply tell us how the campaign is 
performing, but don't necessarily tell us whether a campaign is viable or 
not. 
 These are the metrics that tell us how well each piece or step or stage or 
page of a marketing campaign is performing.  
 
Let’s dive deeper into each of these now starting with Performance Campaign Metrics.  
  
 

## Page 37

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 37 Performance Campaign Metrics  
 
I’m going to illustrate performance campaign metrics with a funnel 
example with five steps. Bear in mind, i f your funnel  has more steps than 
what it is that I'm about to show you, then you'll have more metrics.  
 
Likewise, if your campaign has less steps than what I'm about to show 
you, then of course you'll be using less performance campaign metrics.  
 
Let's say your funnel  consists of an opt-in page, a sales page, an order 
form  page , an upsell  page , and a thank you page. 
 
 
 The first performance metric that we look at is opt- in rate. 
 
This tells us how well the lead generation page in your campaign is performing. What percentage of visitors to that page are being converted 
into leads?  
 
Next, we've got sales conversion rate. And of course, this tells us what percentage of people that reach or consume your marketing and sales 
message turn into visits to your order form.  
 
How many people are clicking the add to cart button or the checkout 
button?  
 


## Page 38

John Mulry 
 
 
 38 Then we've got order form completion rate. This is the percentage of 
people that hit your order form and enter their details, press the button, 
and complete their transaction.  
 
We look at and separate sales conversion rate and order form 
completion rate from one another because these are two different steps 
in the checkout process.  
 
You could have a marketing and sales message that does well , sends a 
lot of people over to your order form and you can have an issue on your 
order form causing a low order form completion rate.  
 So, we separate these two out so that we can better assess what's going 
on.  
 If we didn't look at these as two different numbers, it would be 
extremely difficult for us to understand whether the problem is the 
marketing and sales page or whether the problem is the order form.  
 
Next is your upsell conversion rate.  
 
If you have one upsell, it's the conversion rate on that one upsell. If you have two, it's both of those. If you have three, it is the conversion rate for each of those three.  
 Finally , we have the average order value contribution .  
 Now this is different from average order value, which we're going to 
talk about in a different chapter.  
 
Now if you have offers like an upsell, a downsell, a bump, as well as your core offer, you're going to have an average amount of money that 
a buyer spends with you because some buyers may take advantage of 
just the core offer.  
 

## Page 39

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 39 • Some may take advantage of, let's say the core offer and a bump 
offer.  
 
• Some may take advantage of the core offer, bump offer, and the first upsell.  
 
• Some may take advantage of every offer that you hav e.  
 
Average order value tells us what's the average amount of money you 
collect when a buyer goes through your funnel .  
 
Average order value is an extremely critical number that falls under the 
financial campaign metrics.  
 
It tells us a lot about the financial viability of a campaign.  
 Average order value contribution is how much money does a particular 
upsell or downsell or bump offer contribute to your overall average order value.  
 Does having an upsell contribute an additional $9 on average,  for 
example, to the average amount of money that a buyer spends with you 
or does a different upsell contribute $12 to the average amount of money 
that a buyer spends with you?  
 
It’s one of the most important number s to know as you're about to see 
because it tells us which one the better performing , the upsell or 
downsell or bump offer.  
 Let's look at how you calculate these numbers because this is very 
simple. 
 

## Page 40

John Mulry 
 
 
 40  
 
Let's say you are running an ad that goes to an opt -in page and you send 
a thousand people to that opt -in page and out of those 1000 people, 500 
people give you their email address.  
 500 people fill out your form on that page and become a lead thousand visitors, 500 leads.  
 
That tells us that you have a 50% opt -in rate. That tells us how well that 
page is performing.  
 
Why? Because that page is there to do one thing and one thing only, and 
that is turn a visitor into a lead, turn a visitor into an opt- in.  
 
Now, let's say out of the 500 people that visit the sales page, 50 of them click the add to cart button and go over to your order form.  
 
Well, now that tells us that we have a 10% sales conversion rate.  
 
Remember, in this context, the 10% sales conversion rate, what we're 
talking about here is what percentage of people that hit the sales page, click the button, and go over to the order form. 
 We're not talking about what percentage of people are checking  out 
entering their credit card information. We're trying to assess how well your marketing and sales page is doing to move people to the next step in the campaign.  


## Page 41

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 41  
And so here we see that the sales page has a 10% sales conversion rate. 
We take the total number of visitors divided by the total number of 
people that took the action that gives us 10%.  
 
Now let's say out of the 50 people that visited the order form, 40 people 
enter their contact details, their payment details, and click the checkout button. 
 
Well, that means we have an 80% order form completion rate, 80% of the 
people that hit the page completed the order form and checked out. We take the 50 divided by 40, and that gives us 80%.  
 
Now let's say we have 40 people that go over to the upsell page. And we see that eight people took advantage of the upsell, meaning eight people clicked the button saying, add this to my order.  
 
Well, 40 divided by eight gives us a 20% upsell conversion rate. That's 
how we determine the upsell conversion rate or the transaction maximization offer conversion rate.  
 
You can see right off the bat, those first four metrics, very simple to 
calculate. The value of this is in understanding the performance of each 
step, each stage in the campaign. You need to know how each step, or 
each stage is performing so that we can identify if there is an issue, what 
is the issue?  
 
We don't want to operate in the dark and wonder, is it the opt -in page?  
Is it the sales page? Is it the order form? Is it the upsell page?  


## Page 42

John Mulry 
 
 
 42  
We don't want to have to operate in the dark when identifying the 
constraint, the weak link in the chain. We want to use metrics and data 
to tell us.  
 
These metrics give us insight into what's underperforming, what is 
performing well so that we can identify an issue when an issue exists.  
 
Now let's talk about the AOV contribution number, the average order 
value contribution number.  
 
The way to calculate this is we look at the upsell conversion rate which 
in this case is 20%, and the price of the upsell.  
 
Let's say in this example here, we have a $60 upsell. This is regardless of 
what the core offer price is, regardless of what people have paid up to 
this point to determine the contribution to average order value of this 
offer right here.  
 We take the price,  and we multiply it by the conversion rate.  
 
20% of $60 tells us that this upsell has a $12 average order value 
contribution.  
 
What this means is that for everybody that hits this page on average, 
they are worth an extra 12 bucks because of this upsell.  
 


## Page 43

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 43 Some people will take advantage of this offer, right? We know that some 
people in this case, 20% will take advantage of it, they'll pay $60.  
 
The other 80% won't take advantage of this offer. And so, to them, this 
offer is worth zero, but with direct response when it comes to 
performance campaign metrics, we look at averages . 
 
Having this offer in place adds on average an additional $12 to the 
transaction amount of every buyer that goes through this campaign.  
These metrics are your performance campaign metrics.  
 
This is how you tally those metrics,  and you understand now what these 
metrics mean.  
 
Now and this is important, again, these metrics don't tell us whether 
your paid advertising and frontend campaign  is viable or not.  
 
Meaning you could have a 50% opt -in rate you could have a 10% sales 
conversion rate. You can have an 80% order form completion rate, a 20% 
upsell take rate.  
 
That upsell could be contributing $12 to your average order value, but that doesn't tell us whether the campaign is profitable, whether it's ready to be scaled, whether it's viable, meaning that from a financial 
perspective, we want to continue to run it.  
 
It doesn't tell us whether this is poorly performing. It only tells us the performance of the  different pages or stages in your funnel , still critical, 
but these metrics are used when we want to identify the constraint or 
the problem in a campaign.  
 
We want to know what we need to work on, test, tweak, enhance, 
optimize. That's what these metrics are used for.  
 
 
 

## Page 44

 44 Financial Campaign Metrics  
 
Now we're going to talk about your financial campaign metrics. These 
are the metrics that tell you the viability of a campaign. They tell you 
how well you're doing, turning a dollar of traffic into a dollar or more of 
sales of profits.  
 They tell you ultimately what you should be paying for traffic, what 
traffic is worth to you, what a lead is worth to you, and what it's costing 
you to get a lead.  
 This is all about the viability from a financial perspective of your campaign. Now there are six core financial campaign metrics we're 
going to look .  
 
These metrics fall under one of two columns. We're either talking about 
the cost side or we're talking about the revenue side . 
 
Cost Side  Revenue Side  
Cost Per Visitor  Revenue Per Visitor  
Cost Per Lead  Revenue Per Lead  
Cost Per Acquisition  Average Order Value  
 
First, we look at cost per visitor. This is of course, is the cost to get a 
single visitor to your website or funnel . 
 
Next is the cost per lead.  If you're using any kind of opt -in page, or lead 
generation page, if you're using two -step marketing where you're 
generating the lead first, we're going to look at our cost per lead.  
 
How much are you paying to acquire a lead?  
 
Next, we're going to look at cost per acquisition CPA.  
 

## Page 45

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 45 This is one of the most valuable numbers that you'll be using going 
forward with all your paid advertising . 
When it comes to assessing the viability of every single campaign, it 
comes down to how much does it cost you to acquire a single new 
customer? What are you paying on average to acquire a new buyer?  
 
Now this is the cost side of the equation.  
 
We also have the revenue side of the equation, and the first number we 
look at is revenue per visitor.  It’s also sometimes called EPC (earnings 
per click).  
 
This tells you what an average visitor is worth to you. When we say 
revenue per visitor, we know that some visitors are going to come to 
your campaign and they're not going to enter their email address. 
 
That's okay. We're not talking about an actual revenue number per 
visitor. We're really  talking about value per visitor.  
 
What is the average visitor to your campaign worth? Now you should 
see right off the bat that knowing what it's costing you to generate a 
visitor and what a visitor is worth to you tells you whether your 
campaign is viable or not.  
 
If it costs you $5 to get a visitor and every visitor is only worth $2 to you, 
we know the campaign has an issue that needs to be fixed regardless of 
the performance metrics or regardless of how well the different pages are performing.  
 
There is an issue because it's costing us more than what a visitor is 
worth.  
 
We also have revenue per lead as well as average order value or AOV.  
Again , AOV is the average amount of money that a buyer spends with 
you when they go through your frontend funnel . Now let's look  at how 
these are calculated.  

## Page 46

John Mulry 
 
 
 46  
 
Using the previous example, let’s say: 
 
• You had 1000 visitors  
• 500 gave you their email address (50% opt in rate ).  
• 50 of those people clicked to the order form, (10% sales 
conversion rate ) 
• 40 people checked out (80% order form completion rate ).  
• 8 people purchased the upsell (20% upsell conversion rate ).  
 
Now let's look at the cost side of the equation.  
 
 
To calculate your costs at each of these different stages, you need to start 
with the total amount of money that you invested in paid advertising to 
drive the 1000 visitors. Let's say you invested $ 4,000, meaning you 
invested $4 ,000 on Facebook (Meta) ads and you got 1,000 link clicks . 
 
If we take that $ 4,000 and divide it by the 1000, that tells you it costs you 
$4 for each visitor in this instance you drove to your campaign.  


## Page 47

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 47  
Now let's look at the cost per lead. Well, we know you got 500 leads. 
Now we use the same $ 4,000 to calculate your cost per lead.  
 
To calculate your cost per lead you take the $4,000 you invested, and 
you divide it by the total number of leads that you generated in this case, 
500.  
 
That tells you that you have a $ 8 cost per lead. It costs you $8 for each 
lead that you generate.  
 
Now you look at the cost per acquisition (CPA).  
 
Again, you're going to use the $4,000 and you're going to divide that by 
the total number of buyers that we generate.  
 In this instance, you generated 40 new buyers. You see that 50 people hit 
the order form and 40 people checked out, s o you generated 40 buyers.  
 
$4,000 divided by 40 buyers gives you a $100 CPA or cost per 
acquisition.  
 
What this  tells you is you spent $ 100 to acquire each of those 40 buyers.  
 
Now, of course, you can’t determine if this is good or bad out of context 
of the revenue side.  
 
You might ask: is $4  a good cost per visitor? Well, it depends. Is a visitor 
worth $ 8 to you? Because if so, then a $ 4 cost per visitor is great.  
 Are those visitors worth 50 cents to you? Well, if so, that  $4 cost per 
visitor is terrible.  
 You cannot determine whether these are good or bad out of context on 
the other side of the equation. Just like you can't determine whether your 

## Page 48

John Mulry 
 
 
 48 revenue numbers are good or bad absent of the cost numbers on the 
other side of the equation.  
 
Now let's look at the revenue numbers. To calculate these numbers, you 
need to know the price points of the products offered.  
 
 
Let's say you were selling a product for $9 9 and the upsell was $ 49. The 
very first thing that you need to do is calculate how much money you 
earned  from the 40 people that purchased the $ 99 product.  
 
Of course, to calculate that number, you take $9 9, and you multiply it by 
40 which gives you $3,960.  
 
Now you want to look at the upsell. Remember, you had eight people 
take advantage of a $ 49 upsell. To determine how much money you 
generated from that, you take the $49 and multiply it by eight  to give 
you $392.  
 Now, you take the $3 ,960 and you add to it the $ 392 to give you a total 
figure of $4,352 in sales.  
 
Right off the bat, without even looking at the individual financial 
metrics, you can see that you spent $ 4,000 and you generated  500 new 
leads, 40 new customers and $ 4,352 in sales.  
 We know , initially,  this campaign is certainly viable.  


## Page 49

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 49 For every $4,000 that you invest in paid advertising, you bring back 
$4,352. P retty good  so far ? 
 
 
 
Now with that number, you can calculate your individual financial 
metrics because sometimes it's not going to be this crystal clear you've 
got a campaign that's rocking the house. 
 
To calculate the revenue per visitor, now what you're going to do is take 
the total sales and divide it by that 1,000.  
 
That tells you that you've got a revenue per visitor of $ 4.35.  
 
You could see right off the bat with looking at those two individual 
metrics right there, the cost per visitor of $ 4 and a revenue per visitor of 
$4.35.  
 What that means is in this funnel every time you spend $4 to get a visitor,  
you extract out $4.35  
 
$4.35 in this context is a valuable number to know because it tells you 
what you can afford to pay to get a visitor to this campaign.  
 
Now you know what the maximum amount of money is you should 
spend to get a visitor to this campaign. If you spend a maximum of $4.35 


## Page 50

John Mulry 
 
 
 50 per visitor , you know at a bare minimum, you will acquire new buyers 
at break even or you'll acquire buyers for free.  
 
Now you need to calculate the revenue per lead. You do the same thing.  
 
You take the $4 ,352 divided by the total number of leads you generated, 
which is 500. And that tells you that you  have a $ 8.70 revenue per lead.  
 
In this simplistic example, i f you compare the cost to the revenue, it costs 
us $8 to get a lead. But  every time you spen d that $8  to get a lead, you 
generate back $8 .70 for every lead . 
 
And in your paid advertising you now  know if you want to breakeven, 
you can spend up $8.70 to acquire leads and still have an economically 
viable campaign.  
 
If I asked you, would you be willing to generate 10,000 leads if it didn't 
lower your bank balance at all? The answer should be, of course. 
 
Next, you calculate the average order value.  
 
What you do here is take the total sales, $ 4,352 and divide it by the total 
number of buyers. In this case, 40. So $ 4,352 divided by 40 tells you that 
the average order value is $108.80. 
 Remember your CPA in this example is $100.  
 These two numbers right here, CPA and AOV are at the heart and soul 
of paid advertising. Your average order value tells you what a buyer is 
worth to you the day that they become a buyer. This is day 0 value the 
day that they become a buyer.  
 
The average buyer in this example  is worth $ 108.80 to you, which means 
if your level of acquisition aggression (LAA) is Level 2 Breakeven you 
can pay up to $ 108.80 to get a buyer. 

## Page 51

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 51  
Even though in this example you 're selling a $99 offer as your core 
product, you can afford to spend up to $ 108.80 because that's the AOV  
of those buyers.  
 Ultimately the entire game of paid advertising comes down to looking 
at the cost side and looking a nd the revenue side.  
 
What did it cost us to acquire a buyer and what is that buyer worth to 
us on the day they become a customer ? 
 
If those numbers are equal, meaning you have an AOV of $ 108.88, your 
CPA is no more than $ 108.88 you’re acquiring customers for free.  
 
Now, imagine this example is the first iteration of this campaign. With 
no optimization whatsoever. No improvements made.  
 We can improve the metrics both performance metrics and the financial metrics to stack the economics in our favor even more and scale our paid 
advertising even more. 
 
That's why these numbers are at the foundation of being able to drive 
paid advertising and scale your offers with paid advertising.  
 
When you have a situation, where your CPA is higher than your AOV, 
meaning it's costing you more to acquire a buyer than what that buyer 
is worth to you on day zero, that's when you use your performance 
metrics to understand what is going on in the campaign so that you can 
fix it.  
 Because again, CPA and  AOV tells us the viability of a campaign 
regardless of your performance metrics, regardless of what your opt -in 
rate is, your sales conversion  rate is, your order form completion rate is, 
your upsell conversion rate.  
 

## Page 52

John Mulry 
 
 
 52 Regardless of what those are, if you have a $ 200 CPA and you have a 
$108.80 AOV, this campaign isn’t  viable  in its current form .  
 
I don't care if you have a 1% sales conversion rate, I don't care if you 
have a 10 or 12% sales conversion rate, if your CPA is higher than your 
AOV, that campaign isn't viable  right now.  
 I'm sharing this with you again, because I want you to understand your 
performance metrics simply tell you how each step or page in your 
funnel  is performing.  
 They don't  tell you the viability of your paid advertising and frontend 
funnel .  
 
The financial campaign metrics on the other hand, tell you the financial 
viability. They do not tell you how each step or stage in the campaign is 
performing. They only tell you the difference  between cost and revenue.  
 
That's why we use financial campaign metrics and performance 
campaign metrics together to understand what's going on, what needs 
to be fixed, and whether a campaign is viable and ready for scale . 
 
You don't need to get caught up in all the other website analytics and 
numbers. Your financial metrics and your performance metrics are at 
the heart of your ability to scale your campaigns , and ultimately,  scale 
your business.

 53 Lifetime Customer Value and Marginal Net Worth  
 
Now you understand performance and financial metrics, we're going to 
cover two additional metrics: lifetime customer value and marginal net 
worth.  
 
They're very similar as you're going to see, but these two metrics really 
tell you the true value of the assets, the clients, the customers, the subscribers, the buyers that you're acquiring  with paid advertising .  
 
They tell you what the asset is worth over the life of the patronage of 
that asset, of that client, of that subscriber, of that customer.  
 
Remember when we’re running paid advertising, we think of ourselves 
as investors. You’re  investing in the acquisition of assets. Those assets 
are your clients, your customers, or your buyers. And like all assets, 
those assets have a value the day that you acquired them  and a future 
value.  
 
Now let's start with some definitions.  
 
Lifetime customer value is the average amount of money that a customer spends with you over the life of their patronage with your business.  
 
Marginal net worth just considers any costs associated with fulfillment.  
 
For example,  if you have a physical product,  you fulfill and there are 
cost of goods sold, meaning if you sell a supplement, and let's say you 

## Page 54

John Mulry 
 
 
 54 sell the supplement for $50 and there's $20 of costs, well, marginal net 
worth takes that into account to give you the real profit per buyer.  
 
Marginal net worth can be defined as the average amount of profit 
generated from a customer over the life of their patronage with your business.  
 
Now, one thing to understand with lifetime customer value is there are 
different ways you can look at this number. You can look at lifetime 
customer value over the entire lifespan of a buyer, which we know of course, as you're in business for a longer period, the lifetime of a buyer 
is going to grow.  
 
If you've been in business for two years, let's say, well, the maximum amount of time that we can look at is two years.  
 
Or you can look at the lifetime value at different intervals of time. Now this isn't really lifetime value because inherent in the name, lifetime value is lifetime.  
 
What we're really talking about here is customer value at different intervals of time.  


## Page 55

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 55  
Let's say you have a buyer,  and that buyer spends $100 with you on day 
zero, that is your average order value.  
 
Let's say on day 14, the average buyer spends another $25 with you, 
what that would mean is that by day 14, you have a $125 lifetime value or $125 customer value.  
 
That means that on day zero, a customer is worth $100 to you. But by day 14, the average customer is worth $125.  
 
And if on day 30, the average customer spends another $125 with you, maybe some more, maybe some less, but on average $125, that means that by day 30, you have a $250 lifetime value or $250 customer value at day 30.  
 
That tells you right there that within 30 days you grew your customer value from $100 to $250.  
 
If you look at this and you were an investor and I said to you , give me a 
$100 today and in 30 days from now, I'll give you $250 back.  
 
Or if I said to you give me $100 today and I'll give you $100 back today, 
and then in 30 days from now, I'll give you another $150, would you do it? 
 
Of course you would do it , right?  I’m sharing this with you because I 
just want you to see that when you think like an  investor and you realize 

## Page 56

John Mulry 
 
 
 56 that the day zero value is $100, the day 14 value is $125, and the day 30 
value is now $250 because by day 30, they've spent $250 with us.  
 
Now, when I ask you, what would you spend to acquire a buyer?  
 
What would you be willing to spend today? This is why some 
advertisers are willing to spend more than the day zero value.  
 
If I said to you, would you spend $150 today if I gave you back $100  
today  and then in 30 days from now , I gave you another $100, right?  
 
So, you give me $150 today, I give you back $100, meaning now you are 
out of pocket $50 but 30 days from now I'm going to give you another $150, would you do it?  
 Well, the likelihood is yes because, you're going to recoup the $50  you 
went out of pocket for and another $100 meaning it's only going to take you 30 days to be profitable on  this. 
 
If you really think about it means you spent $150 and you made back $250.  
 
How often would you spend $150 and make back  $250, you would do it 
all the time. 
 

## Page 57

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 57 The difference is in when the money comes in. In the graphic above you 
can see that on day zero, we're generating $100.  
 
14 days later, we generate another $25 and then  16 days after we 
generate another $125 bringing the total value of our buyer to $250.  
 
Now on average by day 60 they spent another $125, now your lifetime 
value or your 60-day customer value is $375. 
 
So, what was once an asset worth $100, is worth $375 60 days later. And 
then of course at day 90 if they did it again and spent another $125 that means we've got a total of a $500 lifetime value.  
 
Now in this example, if the average buyer never spent any money again, 
but this was path of the average buyer, some spent more, some spent 
less, but this was average.  
 
What this is telling you is that you've got a $500 lifetime value for a buyer.  Every buyer on average you acquire is going to be worth $500 to 
you.  
 


## Page 58

John Mulry 
 
 
 58 It will take 90  days for that $500 to accumulate, but you know that every 
time you acquire a buyer, they are worth $500 on average .  
 
Again, if I said to you, what would you be willing to invest for a $500 
buyer?  
 
It is these numbers that should determine what you are willing to pay to acquire a customer with paid advertising. 
 
 
And, as an investor you may say, hey, you know what?  
 
I'm willing to spend more than $100 to get this buyer because I know 
that in 90 days, I'm going to have $500 in my pocket.  
 
If you just took all of this money and you put it at the 90-day mark, let's 
say we took the $500 and I said to you, would you invest $50 today to get a buyer if you made no money back today?  
 


## Page 59

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 59 Well, the answer would likely be yes. The only question would be how 
often can you do that? Because you must  wait 90 days to make back the 
full lifetime value.  
These questions, examples and nuances just come back to the idea you're 
investing in the acquisition of assets . Those assets have a value today , a 
cost today and a future value.  
 
Depending on the time intervals that you look at, those values are going 
to differ. But fortunately,  over time, you will know what these numbers 
are.  
 
These numbers will become more statistically valid, more reliable so 
that, you know, on average, by day 30, a buyer is worth $250 for me by 
day 60, an average buyer is worth $375 to me by day 90, the average buyer is worth $500 to me.  
 
And that's going to give you tremendous power in being able to invest 
in paid advertising and in the acquisition of these buyers.  
 
 
 


## Page 60

John Mulry 
 
 
 60 Now let's look at the marginal net worth. Let's just say you've got a $100 
cost for this average individual.  
 
If you’ve got a $100 cost associated with fulfillment on this individual, 
when it comes to day 14, you've got a marginal net worth of $25.  
 
Because even though they spent $125, you had to spend a hundred 
dollars to get them.  
 
And if you look at day 30, your marginal net worth is $150.  
 
It's going to be a $100 less in each case because marginal net worth is just 
considering costs. It’s showing you the profit per buyer.  
 
Let’s breakdown how to calculate these numbers . Thankfully, it’s very 
simple.  
 
For lifetime customer value, you can take the total amount of revenue that you generated over a specified period, whatever that time is that 
you want to look at.  
 
It could be 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months , a year, it could be 
lifetime.  
 
You want to take that total revenue over a specified period and divide it 
by the total number of buyers.  
 

## Page 61

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 61 For example, imagine  you generated $1,000,000 and you had 3,500 
people spent money with you over a 12- month period.  That means you 
have a $285.71 lifetime value  over that period . Again, this is not counting 
any kind of costs to fulfill or acquire those buyers.  
 
This is a pure top line revenue number.  This tells you that each person 
on average spends $285 .71 cents with you. Some could be a lot more. 
Some could be a lot less. Some could buy once;  some could buy 10 times 
from you.  
 
This is the average lifetime value.  
 
Then we've got marginal net worth. Marginal net worth also takes total 
revenue over a specified period minus the cost to acquire and or fulfill 
that sale divided by the total number of buyers.  
 
We're going to use the same numbers from above . 
 
$1,000,000 and the 3,500 . Except here, you're going to subtract a $200,000 
cost.  Let's just say you spent $200,000 to generate the buyer s and fulfill 
them. There are the costs you had.  
 
You take the $1,000,000 minus $200,000 divided by 3,500. That tells you 
that you have a $228.50 marginal net worth or $228.57 profit per buyer.  
 
If you look at the difference between lifetime value  ($285.71) and 
marginal net worth, ($228.57) you have $57.14.  
 
This tells us you have an expense of roughly $57 for every buyer.  

## Page 62

John Mulry 
 
 
 62  
With these numbers you’ll now know  the value of the assets you are 
acquiring.  
 
These are numbers you're going to use to not only determine things like your paid advertising  and what you can afford to invest to get a buyer  
but also to determine what a buyer is worth to you . 
 
These numbers help you answer the question, can I afford to spend more 
to get a buyer based on the 30-day lifetime value or the 60- day lifetime 
value?  
 
These also help you understand how  well you are doing with the  
ongoing monetization of your buyers, because your lifetime value should be going up.  
 
The longer you are in business, the more a customer should become worth to you over time.  
 
The more offers you release, the more opportunities you give for buyers to spend money with you to participate in transactions, the more lifetime value should be increasing.  
 And so , you're able to monitor how well you're doing on the 
backend by looking at your lifetime value going up. The other thing  that 
happens when you monitor what an asset is worth to you is this: as you 
increase the value of an asset, as you increase lifetime value or marginal net worth, you can now invest more to get them.  

## Page 63

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 63 OfferNomics?  
 
Let’s say you were a real estate investor, and you had the ability to 
turn a $500,000 property into a $1,000,000 property.  
 
You’d likely be willing to somewhere between $500K up to $1,000,000 , 
because the difference between what you invest and that $1,000,000 , 
which you can turn it into, is going to be your profit.  
 
So, if you invest $800k to get that $500 k property and you turn it into 
a $1M property and sell it, you bank $200 K in profit.  
 
Now, l et's say you can increase the value of that $500K  property to 
$1.5M.  
 Of course,  you can now afford to spend more than $800 K if you want 
to get that property. You can spend $1M, or you could spend $1.1M  to 
get that property because now  the property is going to be worth a lot 
more to you.  
 
It’s the exact same thing with scaling your offers with paid advertising and the acquisition of new customers. W hen you can make them worth 
more, when you learn how to increase your lifetime value, you can bank more profits.  
 
You make more money, more bottom -line dollars in your business. And 
you also have additional  money you can now use to acquire even more 
buyers, spend even more to acquire a buyer, meaning you can pay more to acquire a buyer because those buyers are worth more to you.  

## Page 64

John Mulry 
 
 
 64  
When you can pay more to acquire a buyer, the game becomes that 
much easier. The game of getting more traffic becomes that much easier.  
 
The person who's able to spend the most to get a buyer, not the least, 
because they have the highest lifetime value,  or the highest customer 
value is rigging the game of paid advertising in their favor.  
 
This is what OFFERNONICS is all about.  
 
If you could spend a $100 to acquire a buyer, but your competition can 
only spend $50 to acquire a buyer because they have a far lower lifetime value than you do, you are going to crush them because you can do infinitely more.  
 
You can do things they can't, you can use platforms they can't. You can 
spend $50 or $60 to get a buyer. They can't. If they spend $60 to get a 
buyer, they'd be losing money every day and cannot continue . 
 
But because you ’re willing to invest $100 , and they're only willing to 
invest $50 because you have a much higher lifetime value.  
 
That's the game.  
 
That’s what OFFERNOMICS is all about.

 65 3, 6 or 9 Feet From Gold?  
 
Ok, by now I’m hoping you’ve a better understanding of the 
foundational  direct response advertising principles we use to scale your 
advertising campaigns so you can engineer OFFERNOMICS.  
 
A.K.A.  the ability to spend the most the acquire front end customers 
at scale. 
 Now, remember the simplistic example we’ve been using of the five -
step funnel? The steps were:  
 
- Optin page  
- Sales Page  
- Order Form Page  
- Upsell Page  
- Thank You Page  
 
The numbers we shared were based on when the campaign was 
launched. As in the very beginning of the campaign.  
 
But as you’re likely aware not all campaigns work right out of the 
gate. In fact, most campaigns do not work out of the gate. 
 We’re in the game of iteration. We ’re constantly trying to improve 
metrics (both performance and financial).  
 

## Page 66

John Mulry 
 
 
 66 It’s the same when we’re working with clients in the E5Agency. 
Some campaigns come flying out of the gate and are hitting KPI’s straight away, others do not.  
 But the difference is in what we do when campaigns don’t initially 
go the way we hope they will. 
 We don’t give up on them, call it a day and say “oh well, I guess paid 
advertising won’t work for this offer…”  
 In fact, I’d go as far as saying, one of the reasons why people can’t 
make paid advertising work for scaling their offers is they give up too soon. 
 Think about it yourself, how many times have you launched a new 
offer to paid traffic, ran some traffic to it, didn’t get the result you 
wanted and instead of iterating, you gave up on that offer and moved 
onto to something else.  
 Sadly, this happens a lot.  
 Not every campaign is going to be a homerun and certainly not 
every campaign is going to be a homerun right from the beginning. The important thing is to not give up.  
 In one of my all -time favorite personal development books Think 
And Grow Rich Napoleon Hill talks about the concept of “three feet from 

## Page 67

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 67 gold” and how with a clearly defined outcome and the power of 
persistence you can achieve anything you want.  
Now, I’m not saying just about any aul campaign you create can be 
a homerun campaign you can scale with paid advertising but when the 
results are not what you expected your reaction should not be to give up 
and move on. 
 You should iterate. And then iterate some more. And then iterate 
again. But not random iteration or random optimization. Pinpointing exactly where your campaign constraint is and what you need to do to 
fix it.  
 This is one of the areas we specialize in the E5  Agency and its exactly 
what I’m going to outline for you now.  
 And it all starts with identifying your weakest link or your campaign 
constraint. 
   
  

## Page 68

John Mulry 
 
 
 68 Your Weakest Link?  
 
There will always be a campaign constraint or weak link in any campaign. It’s  the weakest step in your advertising and/or marketing , 
which when fixed will have the largest positive impact on the overall campaign performance.  
 Think of your paid advertising and frontend acquisition funnel as a 
chain. In every chain, there is a series of links  and there is always a 
weakest link.  
 The weakest link in a chain is what determines the strength of the 
chain. 
 It doesn't matter whether 99 out of 100 links  in the chain can 
withst and 100lbs of pressure. If there's one link that can only withstand 
80lbs of pressure , when that chain experiences more than 80 pounds of 
pressure, the chain is going to snap at that weakest link.  
 Likewise, it doesn't matter if we go in, and we strengthen all of the other 
links. If we make all the other links able to withstand 110 lbs of pressure, 
it doesn't matter. That chain is still going to snap once that pressure exceeds 80lbs . 
 It’s the same in your advertising and marketing. There will always 
be a constraint or sometimes multiple constraints. There's always one 
step, if optimized, it will improve the overall performance of the 
campaign. 

## Page 69

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 69  
There are only three areas we look at when diagnosing, or when 
identifying the constraint.  
 
 
 
1. Media Performance  
2. Campaign Performance  
3. Economic Performance  
 
We always start with the media performance. Whenever you're 
using paid advertising  to scale your offers , and there is a constraint we 
first must  make sure the problem isn't on the media side.  
 If our media performance metrics look good (don’t worry,  I’ll be 
discussing exactly what “good” means shortly) we then move on and look at the campaign performance metrics.

 70 If these look good, we then look at the overall economic performance 
of our campaign . 
 Let's start by diving into how we look at the media performance 
metrics . 
 
 
  The very first thing that we ask ourselves is:  “Is your cost per visitor 
good?”  
 Meaning what you're paying to get a visitor. Is it within proper range? Now I'll walk you through how to determine proper range in a moment 
but first I just want you to understand the process.  
 Now, if the answer is yes, what you're paying to get a visitor is 
within range. Then we move on to the campaign performance.

 71  
There's nothing more that we need to do on the media side. If we're 
paying the right price or within the right range to get a visitor from our 
media, we know the source of the problem, the constraint doesn't fall within the media. It’s as simple as that.  
 Now,  if the answer is no, our cost per visitor is not in range.  
 Then we must  ask a couple of follow -up questions.  
 Are you targeting the right audience?   
 This is, there's only one of two issues that can be the cause of a high 
cost per visitor. Number one is targeting the wrong audience.  
 Are you targeting the right audience? If the answer is no, then this is 
what we are going to fix. Because if you're targeting the wrong audience, you could be getting a low click through rat e. And that low click through 
rate is likely increasing the cost per visitor.  
 You must  understand why this is important.  
 This is important because if you're paying too high to get a visitor,  
ultimately that's going to carry through to a high cost per acquisition. In other words, if you're paying too much to get a visitor, we know you're paying too much automatically to get a lead.  
 We know then that you're paying too much to get a buyer, regardless 
of how well those steps are performing. So , if you're paying too much to

 72 get a visitor, even if your marketing pages are performing well, even if 
your opt- in rate is great, even if your sales conversion rate is great, your 
CPA can still be way too high.  
 
One thing I’ll add is that these days, your issue,  or constraint is 
unlikely to be down to targeting the wrong audience as the paid advertising platforms targeting options are so fine -tuned and even the 
new AI targeting in both Google and Meta are so accurate that’s almost impossible to target the wrong audience.  
 Because of this, it’s important we also look at link click through rate 
as well as cost per visitor. So, we ask one more question.  
 Do you have a solid click through rate?  
 I you're targeting the right audience, are your ads getting a proper 
link click through rate? Again, I ’ll cover proper link click through rate in 
a moment, I just w ant you to understand if the answer is no, then we're 
going to fix this. 
 Fixing the link click through rate, is all about improving the creative, 
the ad copy, the call to action and the image  or video used in the ad.  
 Now what happens if you’re click through rate is solid and within 
range? Then it comes down to economic performance. Then we're going 
to look at the economic side of the campaign.  
 

## Page 73

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 73 It’s like a process of elimination until we find our constraint. Is your 
cost per visitor good? If yes, we go right to campaign performance. If the 
answer is no, then we look at audience and creative . 
 If you are targeting the right audiences, we look the actual creative 
performance. If the answer is no, then we must  fix them .  
 Finally, if you are targeting the right audience , you do have a solid 
click through rate, then the reality is, is that the cost per visitor is the cost per visitor. Meaning if you are running ads to the right audience and you’re getting you a good click through rate, then we have an economic 
constraint.  
 When you have an economic issue, it means your campaign isn't set up 
to extract the value necessary to pay for the cost per traffic.  
 
In that case, we must  adjust the economic s side of the campaign, t he 
pricing side, the AOV side, which we're going to talk about in depth in 
a future chapter.  
 
Now, i magine, you look at your paid advertising performance and your 
cost per visitor and your link click through rate is good. 
 
We now know that the constraint or weakest link is NOT on the 
media buying (the advertising) side of things, so we now look at the 
campaign performance (the marketing) side of things.  
 When it comes to the marketing side, what we're looking at the 
different pages that make up your funnel . 

## Page 74

John Mulry 
 
 
 74  
 
 In this example  gain we’ve got: 
 
• An optin page  
• A sales page  
• An order form page 
• An upsell page  
• A thank you page  
 Now it doesn't matter what  pages or how many pages you have in your 
funnel or what type of funnel you are running.  
 Be it a webinar, a book funnel, a challenge  funnel , a VSL funnel , a live 
event funnel, an application funnel,  the process  is the exact same . 
 
With campaign performance we go through the same process of 
elimination. We first look at the optin rate, then sales conversion rate, 
then order completion, upsell take rate and then AOV contribution. 
 We always start with the earliest page in the campaign.  
 


## Page 75

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 75  
For example, let’s say you had an issue with the opt -in page , we would 
start by fixing the opt -in page first. We look at your opt-in page and ask: 
“Are we getting over a 25% conversion rate? ”  
 
Are we turning 25% or more of our visitors to the opt -in page into a lead?  
 If the answer is no, that's what we're going to fix.  If the answer is yes, 
we go onto the marketing and sales page and marketing and sales page. We're looking for over a 3% conversion. Are we getting at least a 3% 
conversion on this page? If the answer is no, that's what we're going to 
fix, right? If the ans wer is yes, we're going to go on to the order form.  
 Is the order form getting over a 60% completion? Meaning are at 
least 6 out of 10 people that are hitting the order page, filling out the 
order form and completing their checkout. If the answer is no, that's the page that we are going to address. If the answer is yes, then we're going to look at, in this case, the upsell page . 


## Page 76

John Mulry 
 
 
 76  
In this case, is the upsell converting at over 20%? If the answer is no, 
that's the page that we're going to fix. If the answer is yes, meaning that 
if we look at your campaign and you're exceeding these minimums in this area, then it comes down to an econ omic performance. Then we're 
going to have to change the economics of the campaign. 
 This is the process that we go through to identify the constraint, 
because remember, we only want to work on the weakest link. And we want to first identify the weakest link so we're not changing things willy nilly.  
 Write this down:  Nothing  we do is based on assumptions or guesses 
or what you think or believe . We're looking at the data.  
 
 


## Page 77

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 77 We're allowing the data to tell us what the constraint is . We're 
diagnosing the root cause of the problem. And then the prescription, 
which we're going to talk about in the next chapter is based solely on the 
constraint in the funnel.  
 It’s all very formulaic. We only focus on the constraint.  
 
If we look at the paid advertising side of things  and we see we don’t 
have a media buying problem, we look at the campaign performance . 
 What about the economic performance?  
 When we examine the campaign performance and we see the campaign 
is performing but we still have a high CPA, it's still costing you a lot 
more to acquire a buyer than what the buyer is worth to you , then it's an 
economic issue.  
 When I say economics, it really comes down to you setting up your 
campaign so you can extract enough value to pay for the traffic.  
 You see, it’s quite possible everything on the paid advertising side and on the marketing side of things are great but the numbers from a financial or economic point of view don’t make sense.  
 You're targeting the right people . Your cost per visitor is good. Your 
creative is good. Your opt -in rate is good. Your sales page conversion 
rate is good. Your order form completion rate is good. Your upsell take rate is good.  
But what if after all this your paid advertising is still not viable? 

## Page 78

John Mulry 
 
 
 78  
Maybe you've got a campaign set up where your pricing is fa r too low 
based on what the value of traffic is in your market, based on your 
current level of acquisition  aggression (LAA) and based on your current 
conversion window (more on this in a future chapter)?   
 
If your market values traffic at $5 a visitor, then we must  have the 
economics  side of things set up to be able to with reasonable marketing, 
extract enough value to pay that $5 per visitor.  
 It's possible that you can have good media, good campaign 
performance, but not have your pricing set up right to be able to extract that value. And that's important for you to understand that.  
 
You can't expect to fix economic issues with better marketing or better campaign performance.  
 
Let me say it this way.  
 Let's say you are paying $5 a click  and that’s the norm in your industry 
right now. And your media performance is on point.  
 
You're paying $500 to get a hundred visitors. Now, l et's say you are 
selling a product for $10. You have no upsells and your LAA is 
breakeven. Y ou can see straight away there is an economic issue, right?  
 Think about how many people you need to convert into a buyer to 
make that work. You would need to turn 50 buyers out of 100 visitors to 

## Page 79

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 79 break even on that campaign. Meaning you're expecting a miracle from 
your marketing campaign to make that work.  
 That's not a campaign performance issue.  That's not a media issue.  
 That is an economic issue.  
 Meaning we need to fix the economics and you can't fix bad 
economics with better marketing.  
 Obviously, that's an extreme example of paying $5 a visitor and selling a product for only $10.  
 Hopefully, y ou see , if you're paying $5 to get a visitor and you're selling 
a product for $10,  with no upsells at a breakeven LAA,  there’s no agency 
on the planet that make those numbers work.  
 Nothing we do in terms of the marketing campaign, no matter how great 
our headline, our lead, our idea, our argument, our unique mechanism, our offer is going to fix this issue.  
 We're not going to fix that with better marketing . There's an economic 
issue that needs to be addressed.  
 Now I want to mention one more thing before we wrap up this 
chapter. This is a little bit more advanced, but this will give you even more insight into your campaign performance. Now, if we look at the sales page, remember we talk about  the sales page conversion rate of 
3%? We asked ourselves, does the sales page get over a 3% conversion?  

## Page 80

John Mulry 
 
 
 80  
And if not, then this is what we want to fix.  
 
Well, the beauty is when using a VSL or video sales letter , we can look 
for where is the drop -off point.  
We don't want to just say: “Hey, let's change the offer. Or hey, let's change 
the opening, the lead.  Or let's change the marketing argument. Let's change the 
big idea.”  
 We want to identify what the source of the problem is.  
 
The beauty with a video sales letter being used on a marketing and sales 
page is if we identify the sales page is the constraint, we can go in and 
identify what part or piece is the constraint. We can look at video 
analytics and we can look to see where in the video is there a steep drop -


## Page 81

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 81 off. That will tell us where the constraint is or where we want to 
ultimately focus.  
 
For example,  you may see you've got most  people dropping off before 
they ever even see the offer. If we didn't know that and we went in there and we started testing a new offer, well, we would be testing something that isn't the constraint.  
 We'd be testing something that most  people aren't even seeing.  
 If we realize that we're getting an 80% drop- off within the first 60 
seconds, and then by the time folks get to the offer, there's less than 10% of the people are even seeing the offer. We're not going to go in and try 
to fix the offer. 
 We're going to leave the offer. We're going to fix the lead  which is 
the opening of the marketing message .  
 If we see that the constraint or the big drop -off point is in the middle of 
the argument, we're going to go in there and look at why is it confusing? Is it unbelievable? Is it just too verbose? Are we moving or veering off track?  
 Something to consider if you’re using VSL or video sales letters as part of your sales pages.

 82 What To Do When Creative Is Your Constraint?  
 Ok so you’ve identified your creative as your campaign constraint. 
Great. But how do you fix it? As in what are the steps to take or what do 
you focus on?  That’s what we’re going to cover now in this chapter. 
 
First, when to comes to fixing the constraint on the media buying or paid advertising side of things, there's only one of t wo problems it can be : 
either the  targeting or the creative.  
 Campaign Targeting : Now, as mentioned in the last chapter, these days 
it’s nigh on impossible to target the wrong audience, no matter whether you’re using Google Ads (Search, Display, YouTube), Meta (Facebook 
and Instagram) Twitter Ads, TikTok or whatever because their targeting options are so detailed.  
 With  the advancements made with AI targeting, for example 
Advantage+ targeting in Meta ads are so accurate , your targeting should 
rarely be a constraint.  
 I’m not saying it’s never a constraint, I’m saying there’s really no reason why you could be targeting the wrong audience.  
 However, there is ONE BIG caveat to this: your campaign setup.  
 By campaign setup I mean your conversion events setup, and your 
campaign objectives. Let’s breakdown each of these.  

## Page 83

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 83 Conversion Events Setup : Before you ever run any paid advertising 
campaign you must ensure you configure your conversion events 
correctly in the platform you are using.  
 If you’re running paid advertising on Meta (Facebook/Instagram) this means configuring your conversion events via the Facebook Pixel and optionally but recommended Conversions API.  
 If you’re running paid ads on Google (Search, Display or YouTube) this means configuring your conversion events via Google Conversions and optionally but recommended using enhanced conversions.  
 In our agency we generally use Google tag Manager to configure all conversion events for our clients.  
 This may sound elementary, but you would not believe how many 
clients we take on to scale their campaigns and their conversion events 
are all jacked up, or not setup correctly.  And if they are not setup 
correctly, the platforms will be sending the wrong people to your offers thus resulting in subpar media buying performance.  Campaign Objectives: Once you have your conversion events setup, 
tested to show they’re working at every stage of your funnel the next step is in choosing your campaign objective.  
 This is something else we see a lot of people get incorrect.  They are either 
choosing the wrong objective for their campaign or choosing the right objective but with incorrect conversions events setup.  

## Page 84

John Mulry 
 
 
 84 When it comes to campaign objective you want to optimize for the event 
you want. If you want sales optimize for sales, if you want leads 
optimize for leads.  
 In your main conversion campaigns, you never want to optimize for landing page views,  link clicks, video views  or impressions.  The 
algorithms are so smart and are so advanced these days, they know the 
clickers from the buyers, the video viewers from the buyers etc. so it’s critically important you optimize for the event you want.  
 Otherwise, much like with incorrect conversion events setup, the paid advertising platform you’re using will be sending the wrong audiences to your offers.  
 Now, I’m talking about in your main conversion campaigns which makes up about 80 -90% of the type of paid advertising campaigns we 
run. 
 Sometimes we also run secondary campaigns with the other objectives like impressions, video views, reach etc. but for the most part if all you did was make sure your conversion events were setup with 100% accuracy and you optimized for the event you want, you’d go a long 
way towards fixing any issue on the media buying side of things.  
 The only other area to focus on would be optimizing the creative side of things.   

## Page 85

 85 Recently in an internal training I was doing with our E5Agency team I 
made the comment I want to share with you today. It’s never been easier 
to reach your target market, but it’s never been harder to connect with them.   This is because of all the noise, extra competition, distractions, and options available to your potential prospects. So how do we connect with the, well first and foremost we do this via the creative. It’s generally the first part of our paid advertising and frontend acquisition campaign 
your prospects ever see.  In a future chapter, I’m going to break down our process for producing 
creatives, for now I want to focus on improving or fixing creatives when they are your constraint.  Creatives are usually made up of an : 
 
1. Image (or video)  
2. Headline  
3. Body copy.  

## Page 86

John Mulry 
 
 
 86   
When testing creatives  and when creatives are your constraint, it’s first 
important to know some benchmark numbers. The following are general numbers or KPI’s we use to gauge how good our creatives are 
doing.  
 We’ll focus on two of the biggest platforms for now. Facebook advertising and YouTube advertising.  
  


## Page 87

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 87 Optimizing Your Meta Creatives  
 
 
 
The main  metric s in our dashboard we look at when judging creative 
are: 
 
• Cost Per Result (In relation to our target)  
• Amount Spent  
• Link Click Through Rate (LCTR)  
 These are not the only ones we look at but the combination of these three are we spend the most of our time.  
 First, we ask ourselves: “Are we hitting our KPI’s?”  
 If we are great, if we are not, we then look at what ads are getting the 
most spend and then we look at link click through rate.  
These are the Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads benchmarks we usually 
aim for  with link click through rate  (LCTR) : 
• Good: 1%+  
• Better: 1.5%+  
• Great: 2%+  


## Page 88

John Mulry 
 
 
 88 Now obviously, sometimes you can have an ad with subpar LCTR that’s 
still producing good results.  
 Facebook prioritizes whichever ad they believe will get you the result you want. Often that may not be the ad with the lowest cost per result or the highest LCTR.  
 Our budgets are not set at the ad level. They are either set at the campaign level or ad set level depending on what way we have set up the campaign.  
 If we see an ad getting the majority of spend but has a poor LCTR compared to our benchmarks we will rework that ad to improve LCTR.  Facebook are telling us they believe this ad has the greatest potential to get us the result, so we want to maximize that ad and work on 
improving it.  
 
If the LCTR’s are not at least hitting these metrics this is where we need 
to start to optimize and test.  
 With Facebook Ads, we ask ourselves questions like:  
 
1. What is the angle or the hook of the creative?  
 For example, is it a “towards heaven” angle or “away from hell” angle? Can we switch it up or come at things from another angle. We’ll be covering this in more depth in a future chapter.  

## Page 89

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 89  
2. Does the creative stop the scroll?  
 
For example, does the creative stand out in the feed or does it stand out from other ads in the feed.  
 
3. Is our headline click worthy?  
 After the main part of your creative (the image or the video) arguably 
the next thing people see is your headline, then the body copy of primary text.  
  
4. Is our body copy/primary text strong enough?  
 Are we hooking them in the opening, are we being succinct enough? Are we using emojis, if not , can we?  
 If we’re using video creatives, we ask questions like:  
 
5. What’s our video thumbnail like? What’s the opening of the video like?  
 Is it eye catching?  Does it invoke curiosity, hope, excitement, education, 
transformation and or differentiation and make you want to keep watching?  
    

## Page 90

John Mulry 
 
 
 90 6. Do we have captions burned in? 
 
 
 77% of conversions come from videos with sound off so we always want to make sure our creatives have captions burned in.  
 
7. What’s our LCTR like across different placements?  
 
We can oftentimes increase our LCTRs by going the extra mile and 
creative placement specific creatives rather than using the one creative for everything.  
 This means having story ads for stories, reels for reels, mobile optimized 
videos and images for mobile feeds, desktop optimized images and 
videos for desktop feeds and so on.  
 


## Page 91

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 91 As you can see there are a lot of variables that goes into dialing in your 
creatives.  
 
Our process for implementing and testing new variables based off the 
answers of these is as follows.  
 We always start with testing the things that scream not whisper.  
 For us the elements of creative that scream are:  
 
• Hook/Angle  
• Image/Video representing that hook/ angle. 
• Headline  
• Body Copy/Primary Text  
 
For testing we like to isolate and test angles independently.  
 
Meaning we test various angles but test the individual components of those angles (image/video, headline, and body copy) off each other not off other angles all together. Let’s illustrate this with an example.  
 Let’s say you have a health supplement and one of the angle’s we want 
to test is around boosting your immune system.  When running Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads we use a 3x3x3 formula for testing creative angles.  
 We test 3 visual representations of that angle (all images or all video  not 
a mix) with 3 headlines and 3 primary texts.  

## Page 92

John Mulry 
 
 
 92  
This gives us 27 different variations of that angle we can test.  
 
This test can be done all at once inside of the Meta Ads Platform. The 
way we used to do it was with Dynamic Creative Testing, but they have recently rolled out a new update called Flexible Ads which allows us to essentially do the same thing.  
 When testing, one question we get asked a lot is:  
 How long do you run your tests for?  Firstly, we are never not testing. Typically, we allocate about 20% of your overall budget for testing. For example, if you’re spending $30K a month on ads we’ll allocate roughly 20% of that for testing new creative.  
 
The goal of our testing is to find winners we can then scale.  
 
How much do we allocate to each ad?  
 Ideally, we like each to spend at least 1X your CPA  in phase one of 
testing and then 3X to 5X your CPA  in phase two.  
 For example, if you’re  willing to invest $100 to acquire a customer, we 
like to see our testing ads spend this as a minimum.  
 If they spend 1X CPA and achieve a result we move them to phase two of testing which is 3X to 5X your CPA.  

## Page 93

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 93  
One thing to note, not all the 27 ads in the 3X3X3 testing protocol will 
hit those spend thresholds because of how Meta priorities budget 
towards the ones they believe will give you the result you want.  
 This is ok. We’re looking to find the 3,4, 5 ads out of the 27 with the most 
potential . When we find them , we move them into scaling,  and we start 
the process over again.  
 To close off this chapter on optimizing creative when it’s your constraint I want to give you a breakdown of some surefire ways you can increase your L CTRs.  
 
 
First and foremost, in the image or the opening of the video we go heavy on big text with some detail that catches the eye, either an arrow or pointing at something or a gesture of some sort.  
 


## Page 94

John Mulry 
 
 
 94 Next , we make sure our headline is congruent with the image and copy 
as well as the copy on the page we’re sending people to.  
 Now, something else we do is in the body copy portion of the ad.  
 We always like to use “dog whistle language . 
 This is language our target market uses that maybe other people who are not in our target market don’t use.  
 We also like to use pattern interrupts, as well as either poking the bear  
or poking fun at something or  highlighting something polarizing like a 
common enemy.  
 Leveraging this approach is  great for getting high engagement on your 
ads.  
 Getting likes, comments, reactions and shares on your ads give the platforms what they want – people interacting with your posts , and they 
can be great for driving down other metrics like CPMs, and increasing metrics like impressions, reach, and creative quality.  
 I used to be of the opinion the only goal of an ad is to get the click.  
 My position on this has changed a lot over the last 12 -18 months as we’ve 
seen our best performing and longest performing ads have all been the ones with the highest engagement.  
 

## Page 95

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 95 On top of that here are some other ways of increasing your creative 
CTR’s on Meta (Facebook and Instagram)  
 
1. Use High Contrast Images  
 
 
 
When it comes to making your ad stand out in Facebook and Instagram 
one question, we constantly ask ourselves is:  
 “What can we do to stop the scroll?”  


## Page 96

John Mulry 
 
 
 96 People are on their phones scrolling like crazy and you maybe have a 
second or two to catch their attention.  
 
High contrast images are something that catch the eye, so we aim to 
always do our best to make sure our images stand out against the platform but also stand out against everything else.  
 Your image itself should have a high contrast but if you can try to also have contrast between elements in your image. The example above, the red, white, and black really stands out.  
 
2. Diagonal with Desired CTA  
 
 
Our eyes naturally follow lines  and we naturally read left to right.  If 
you look at the image above and follow the line down it brings your eye right down to the call to action.  


## Page 97

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 97  
Remember, if we can first capture attention, we can then keep it and 
engage further by the other elements in our ads.  
The ad example above also uses comparison style or before and after style. It illustrates the situation prospects might be right now and where they would love to be. This ad is a great example of combining away from pain and towards pleasure at the same ti me.  
 The use of emojis in the actual image too is eye catching.  
 
3. The Ugly Text Ad  
 
 
Large text ads look very native in Facebook as they look like normal posts but when you add some color contrast with a grey or whitespace at the bottom, they stand out even more. 
 


## Page 98

John Mulry 
 
 
 98 These work well for short text based testimonial ads or short statement -
based ads.  
 They are certainly not the prettiest looking ads, and they may not be on brand but we’re not in the pretty ad business, were in the direct response advertising business.  If the ads are producing the result you want, does it really matter?  
 
4. Black and White With Color Focus  
 
A black and white ad is not something you see a lot and because of this it stands out in the newsfeed.  
 On top of that adding a color element to a black and white ad makes it stand out even more.  
 


## Page 99

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 99 Your eye is immediately drawn to the color in the image and the 
question marks and arrows invoke curiosity.  
 
Not to mention the fact that Todd is pointing at the actual thing as well directs your attention and focus on the ad, stopping the scroll.  You almost try and read what the words on the page are saying too and you can’t help but click to find out more.  
 
5. The Relevant Random  
 
I’m sure you’ve heard of using pattern interrupts ads, it’s certainly nothing new.  The relevant random ad is one where we use a random 
image that seemingly has nothing to do with the business, offer or campaign but then weave together a story connecting the image with offer or focus of the ad.  
 If you were to see this ad you might think:  


## Page 100

John Mulry 
 
 
 100  
“What do two creepily dressed kids have to do with reason I’m struggling to get 
clients?”  So, you stop scrolling, read the post and find out. If you use this type of 
an ad, it’s  important to bridge the gap and make the connection between 
the random image and your offer otherwise you’ll get attention yes,  but 
you’ll lose it just as fast.

 101 Optimizing YouTube Ad Creatives  
 
The process for fixing your creative constraint when you’re running ads on YouTube is similar, but they are some nuances which I want to cover 
now.  
 
These are the benchmarks and KPI’s we aim for when running 
YouTube Ads  With YouTube Ads we focus on both view rate and CTR . We like to have 
an in -stream view rate of about 20% and our CTR benchmarks are:  
 
• Good: 1%+  
• Better: 1.5%+  
• Great: 2%+  
 We primarily run skippable in-stream  ads. These are the ads that are 
shown before the video someone originally wanted to watch.  This is an 
important thing to note. Someone has decided to watch a video and it’s our job to convince them to watch our video instead.  
 Either they searched for a topic, person, interest or video in the YouTube search bar, clicked on a video they wanted to watch on the YouTube home screen or were shown a video in their feed or whatever.  
 Then before they watch that video, they are shown our ad. We have five seconds where we have their undivided attention before they can choose to skip. These five second are where we do the bulk of our testing and tweaking because they can make or break you r ad. Let me explain.

 Facebook, Instagram are distraction platforms. People go to those platforms to switch off.  
 People go to YouTube to switch on. They go to YouTube to be entertained or educated.  
 
People watch YouTube videos to learn things, to go deep into topics that 
interest them, and they go there to be entertained.  
 
Now, I’m not saying you must entertain people in your YouTube ads. If you’re naturally entertaining or if your product or service lends itself to entertainment, then yes, be entertaining.  
 


## Page 103

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 103 For everyone else, we must focus more on being educational, being 
useful, being valuable to keep in line with what people want.  
There are some other core differences between YouTube Ads and 
Facebook Ads you should be aware of.  
 
1. YouTube Ads typically take longer to start getting results.  
2. Once you start getting results, scaling is typically easier.  
3. Compliance is (mostly) not an issue.  
4. Your creatives don’t suffer with as much ad fatigue as on Meta.  
5. There are less placements, but you have more attention.  
 
Ok so what do you do when your creatives on YouTube are your constraint?  
 First, we need to determine WHY our YouTube ads are the constraint.  
As mentioned, much like with Meta ads, there’s no reason why your 
targeting should be off in your YouTube Ads.   I’ll share some of our 
targeting secrets in a moment but first let ’s dive into optimizing your 
YouTube ad creatives.  
 
We first ask ourselves:  Are we hitting a 20% view rate and a CTR of 1.5%?  
 
 If our CTR is within our KPI but our view rate is not I’m generally ok with that. In the example above you can see view rate is 18.21% which is close to 20% but the CTR is 1.7% which is in KPI.  


## Page 104

John Mulry 
 
 
 104 If we’re not in KPI, we know we need to optimize our actual video 
creative as they are not doing what they should be doing.  
 If we are hitting those metrics, we would look at our audience set up, targeting or ensure we have activated the 7 campaign odds enhancers 
(more on these shortly).  
 When looking at optimizing our ad creative we run through similar questions as we do with Meta.  
 
1. What is the angle or the hook of the creative?  
 We use six different hooks or openings for our ads which I’ll detail more about in the next chapter. These hooks/angles are great for YouTube 
ads, but they also work great for coming up with angles for all ads.  
 
2. Do the first 5 seconds grab attention of our market?  
 The opening 5 seconds of the ad is critical. Our goal is to have hook our ideal prospect while also repelling everyone else.  
 
3. Does our video thumbnail stand out?  
 This is more for when our ad shows on the YouTube home screen but it’s still important.     

## Page 105

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 105  
4. Do we have captions burned in? 
 
Much like Meta, captions on videos in YouTube have always performed 
better than those without.  
 
5. What about our supplementary copy?  
 Along with your video ad you have  a: 
 
• Up To 5 Call To Actions  
• Up To 5 Headlines  
• Up To 5 Long Headlines  
• Up To 5 Descriptions  
 
While the bulk of the heavy lifting is done with the actual video creative, 
the copy that goes with your video ad is important too  and should not 
be overlooked .  
 If our metrics are close to our benchmarks (within 10% -20% of KPI’s) we 
usually optimize our copy first.  
 We use all 5 of each of the supplementary copy sections of the ad. Google will then prioritize the best performing ones for you.  
 Now, if our metrics are nowhere near our KPI’s we likely need to come 
up with new video creatives altogether. 
 

## Page 106

John Mulry 
 
 
 106 We use our Attention Architecture framework for scripting, crafting, 
and shooting video ads.  
 
Attention Architecture  
 When it comes to video ads, we use a four -stage process for creating 
them. 
 
 
• Interrupt: Attention grabbing hook or opening  
• Engage: Showcase authority around what they want  
• Educate:  Teach, demonstrate, or give results in advance  
• Offer:  Give them a clear CTA on what to do next  
 
We do the bulk of our testing around the opening  or the hooks  of the 
video ad.  
 


## Page 107

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 107 We have six different opening types we use .  
We mostly keep the rest of the video the same, meaning the authority 
intro, the educate section and the CTA are the same. Sometimes we test 
variations of these,  but we find for the most part it’s not necessary. For 
every video we create we end up with six videos. This is what it looks like when it’s mapped out.  Video 1: Heaven Hook + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
Video 2: Hell Hook + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
Video 3: Logic/Stats + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
Video 4: Direct Focus + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
Video 5: Taste vs. Tease + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
Video 6: Meet X + + Authority Intro + Educate + Offer.  
 Remember each ad in YouTube can be tested with up to:  
 
• 5 Call To Actions  
• 5 Headlines 
• 5 Long Headlines  
• 5 Descriptions  
 When we put all this together, we end up with 3,750 potential ad 
variations  in total, all from these 6 initial ads.  
 6 Videos x 5 CTAs X 5 Headlines X 5 Long Headlines X 5 Descriptions  
gives us 3,750 potential combinations from all these elements.  
 Our confidence level is high when we have these many combinations for 
testing.  

## Page 108

John Mulry 
 
 
 108 Part 1: The Interruption  (0 – 30 Secs)  
 Let’s break down each video ad component in more detail starting with 
the six different hooks/openings.  
 
1. The Heaven Opening  
 This is our “towards pleasure ” opening . We ask ourselves: What does 
heaven look like for our prospect?  
 What’s the ultimate goal they are looking to achieve in relation to the product/service/offer we’re promoting.  
 For example: For one of our clients in the stock trading niche, their target market is men and women aged 50+.  
 
One of their markets big goals is to trade profitably and beat the returns 
of the S&P 500 so they can retire early or comfortably.  
 So, we might have a  “Heaven” opening like:  
 “Here’s a step -by-step game plan on how to trade stocks profitably, so you can 
consistently beat the returns of the S&P 500 and maybe even retire early.  
 All using a unique order flow stacking strategy that makes it easy for you to pinpoint what stocks to buy, when to buy them and when to sell them.”  
  

## Page 109

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 109  
2. The Hell Opening 
 
This is our “away from pain” opening. We ask ourselves: What does hell 
look like for our prospect?  
 What’s the one thing that’s happening to them right now that’s preventing them from achieving their goal that we can solve for them?  
 For example: For our client in the stock trading niche, one of the big benefits of their system is it helps you pinpoint exactly what stocks to trade and how to trade them, without having to spend a lot of time sifting through financial news, stock reports  or using complicated 
technical analysis.  
 We’ve found that this was a big complaint for a lot of people. They either 
don’t understand all that stuff or they don’t have time do that stuff 
because they’re busy with their full -time job or other commitments.  
 So, we might have a “H ell” opening like:  
 “Great news. You no longer need to spend hours sifting through financial news, 
stock reports or using complicated technical analysis to find the perfect stocks to trade.  
 Instead, you can leverage this unique order flow stacking strategy that makes it 
easy for you to pinpoint what stocks to buy, when to buy them and when to sell them.  All in about 15 minutes a day. ” 
 

## Page 110

John Mulry 
 
 
 110 3. The Logic/ Stats  Opening 
 Here we simply introduce some statistics related to your prospects that they will either find disturbing, intriguing, exciting or thought 
provoking.  
 Ideally from a source they would recognize although this isn’t a prerequisite.  
For example, again using our stock trading client.  
 “Here’s a shocking statistic. Only 1.6% of retail stock traders are profitable over 
a 1-year period. That means not even 2 out of every 100 everyday folks who 
trade stocks will make money over a 12 -month period.  
 Want to know the reason why? And better still what you can do about it ” 
 
4. The Direct Their Focus Opening 
 This one and the next one are two of my favorite and the ones we’re seeing a lot of success with right now for clients.   
 I must give credit to the amazing copywriter Kyle Milligan for this one as he really helped us hone this opening and make it even more powerful.  
 Essentially with this opening we are directing their attention or focus to something on the screen, either something in shot or something overlayed.  

## Page 111

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 111  
We might be holding something in our hand we want them to look at.  
 
We might have a screen open with an arrow pointing at something or we might do a combination of these things.  Our goal is to get them to 
snap out of their train of thought and get them to pay attention to us.  
 For example:  
 
 
 “See this document I'm holding in my hand? It mightn't look like much, but if you're looking for more traffic, more leads, and more sales online it could open the floodgates for you.  
 
With it, you'll be able to quickly get the attention of your most ideal clients and 
customers and likely do it at a much lower CPA than what you’re currently paying.”  


## Page 112

John Mulry 
 
 
 112 5. The Taste Vs. Tease Opening  
 The taste vs tease opening is a slight variation on something we first learned from a fantastic Steal Our Winners episode from Rich Schefren 
and Walter Burch.  
 Essentially here, what we do is, instead of teasing them on what’s about to come in our video, we just give it to them.  
 So, a typical tease type video might say something like:  
 “In this video today I’m going to share the three things you need to do trade stocks profitably.  
 I’ll share why you’re not making more money in your trades as well as detailing exactly how I pick stocks, how I trade them and how I ensure I make more money 
from every trade I take.”  
 
I think you’ll agree there’s nothing inherently wrong with this opening. Except one thing.  
 All it’s doing is teasing the prospect and your prospect is sick and tired of being teased.  
 Your competition is teasing them, you’ve likely been teasing them and they have a lot of options to choose from, they don’t have a lot of time, their attention span is shorter than ever before and you’re annoying them with an ad before the video they wanted to watch.  

## Page 113

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 113  
On top of that , since the introduction of smart phones, social media and 
short form videos, our brains can process more information than ever 
before. Especially when that information is presented both in visual form and auditory form.  
 So instead of teasing them we just give them the TASTE.  
 “The reason why you’re not making money trading is because you’re likely ignoring sector rotation, you don’t look at the open price across multiple time frames and you ’re not using a profit maximizer on your winning trades.”  
 For the average trader who has no idea what these things are, lightbulbs 
are going off in their head  in the first 5 secs of the video, there’s a massive 
amount of value up front, there’s an initial payoff or dopamine hit for the viewer, so they are much more likely to keep watching it.  
  This is one of our favorite openings to use right now because so many 
others are still teasing instead of just getting straight to the action.  
 
6. The Meet X Opening  
 
This is our testimonial based opening we use. It works great for taking text- based testimonials and using them in video.  
 Imagine there was a text -based testimonial that said something like:  
 “Within a week I was making more mo ney trading using Order Flow 
Stacking than I did my previous six months.” – Jane Doe  

## Page 114

John Mulry 
 
 
 114 To open with this, we would show the testimonial on screen and say 
something like:  
 “Meet Jane, a single  mother of four. Within a week she of using our Order Flow 
Stacking trading system, she has made more money than she’s made in the last six months and she’s well on our way to her dream of retiring early. ” 
 You can probably notice this opening also has a “direct their focus” angle just done slightly differently.  
 It also expands on the actual words said, paraphrasing and bringing in some of the main benefits of the offer being advertised. Plus, if you have extra information on the people who give you testimonials and they give you permission to use it you can beef up the opening even more.  
 “Meet Jane, a single  mother of four ” is more real than “Meet Jane .”. You can 
visualize Jane in your mind’s eye better when you see her as a single mom versus when it’s just Jane.  
 Plus, it adds an element of ease to the overall system being advertised. After watching/hearing this opening in a video you might think:  
 “If it’s working for a single mom of four, surely it might work for me?”  
 Those are our SIX openings we like to use.  
 Remember the goal of the opening or your YouTube video (or any video ad for that matter) is to hook in your prospect and have them excited, 

## Page 115

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 115 intrigued, curious enough to forget what it is they were about to watch 
and focus instead on watching your ad.  
 
Think of it like fishing . You bait your hook and cast it in the water. The 
fish bites but before you start reeling them in you must set the hook by yanking back on the rod as hard as you can.  Same thing with the 
opening of your video. Set that hook then reel them in J. 
 Once you have set the hook in our prospects with one of our six openings, the next part of your video ad is all about engaging them.  
 Part 2: The Authority Introduction  (15 – 30 Secs)  
 We do this with an authority introduction.  This is not where we spend 
2 minutes rhyming off how great you are listing all your accolades, your awards and everything that makes you fantastic.  
 People do not care about you.  
 They care about themselves.  
 You could probably write that down and keep it on your desk somewhere as a constant reminder.  
 We like to keep the authority introduction 15 secs to 30 secs max and we position ourselves solely in how we can help them achieve what they want to achieve. Nothing else.  
 For example:  

## Page 116

John Mulry 
 
 
 116  
“Hi, My name’s Pete Renzulli. Since 2001 I’ve helped over 10,000 people trade 
stocks profitably using a unique Order Flow Stacking system.”  
 That’s it. One sentence. Nothing more. That’s the intro done. It showcases expertise, credibility, social proof as well as a unique way of getting the result.  Part Three: The Education Stage  (30secs to 2mins)  
 This the main part of our video and is usually anywhere from 30 secs to a minute or two minutes. We’ve found videos with an overall length of under 3 mins do best with ones under 2 minutes doing better.  
 It’s important to test however as every market is different.  
 
In the education stage we usually take two approaches:  
 
1. We unpack the unique mechanism (the unique method, way or 
system you have for getting the desired result your prospect wants).  
2. We help them get results in advance by outlining some the problem or problems they have as well as the solution to that problem or problems.  
    

## Page 117

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 117 For example,  here’s an education stage script we use for our stock 
trading client. 
 “If you’re like most traders I’ve coached over the last 24 years, at some point, 
you think you've nailed down a winning strategy.  
 You make a few great trades and say to yourself: "I got this."  
 But then when it matters most, you make a trade that tanks your account. And all that progress you thought you made falls apart like a house of cards.  
 You know why that happens? Because nothing you’ve been doing to make profitable trades gets to the root of the problem.  
 You’ve probably been using multiple trading signals or patterns. Or knowingly or unknowingly combining different trading methods or approaches you’ve 
picked up over the years.  
 
Or maybe you’ve been trading market news or following advice from people in forums or on social media. Or perhaps you’ve been trading with aggressive stops to mitigate your risk. But all those things. And everything else you’ve been working on, ignore the root cause of your trading losses.  
 And the same with any other problem. If you ignore the root cause of the issue. Things get worse. And nothing causes you more stress and financial insecurity than following outdated or ineffective trading strategies.  
 That's why I've spent over 30 years perfecting a trading method for regular folks looking to extract profits from the market.  

## Page 118

It’s called Order Flow Stacking.  
 
It’s a simple approach any trader can follow to achieve consistent profits:  
- There’s no confusing trading signals or patterns  
- You don’t have to stare at your computer all day reading stock reports  
- There’s no guessing when to get into a trade or when to exit.  
 The reason it works so well is because it  shadows the big trading institutions in 
real time and  pinpoints  exactly  what stocks to trade, at what price to buy them 
and when you should sell them.”  
 Part 4: The Offer (15 – 30 secs)  
 The last part of video is the offer part of call to action (CTA). This is simply where we tell our prospects exactly what we want them to do 
next. We also optionally show them exactly what will happen when they do it.  
 For example:  
 “To see the same  Order Flow Stacking  system  that has helped over 10,000 
traders have used to stop losing money to the markets  and start making the 
returns you want.

 When we combine all these four elements together, we get six scripts.  
 We have six openings and then rest of the video script.  
 For example, using the TASTE opening above the full script would be:  Taste vs. Tease Script in Full:  
 The reason why you’re not making money trading is because you’re likely ignoring sector rotation, you don’t look at the open price across multiple time frames and you’re not using a profit maximizer on your winning trades.

scripts.

 122  
Now let’s say you have created ads modelling this framework and your 
ads are running and you’re hitting a KPI or 20% view rate and have a CTR of at least 1.5%.  
 Is there anything else you can do to improve performance on the media buying side of things  when it comes to Google Ads/YouTube Ads ? 
 Absolutely yes there is.  
 You can manipulate your audiences/ targeting or activate one of the 
seven campaign odds enhancers to improve your media performance 
even more.  That’s what we’re going to cover next.  
 
           

## Page 123

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 123 Google Knows Everything (Why This Is Good News)  
 
Google’s targeting capabilities are arguably better than Meta’s. Because  
Google knows everything.  
 According to W3Tech, 54.8% of all websites have Google Analytics installed. Even if you don’t have it installed, the sites you use every  day 
to run your business, to do the things you love to DO have it installed.  
 This is good news because allows us as advertisers  to tap into this data 
in so many (some sneaky) ways.   
 And when you’re running YouTube ads you get to leverage all the Google targeting arsenal in your campaigns.  
 Likewise for any Google campaign whether that be Search Ads, Google Display Network, Gmail Ads, Shopping ads or YouTube Ads.  
 
We’re going to focus on YouTube ads here.  
 
Once we get our creatives hitting our KPI’s in our YouTube campaigns and we want to improve performance even more we start to pull on the many audience/targeting levers Google affords us.  
 For example , we have nine go to audience/targeting types we use in our 
YouTube Ad campaigns:   
1. Affinity Audiences:  

## Page 124

You can r each users based on what they're passionate about and their 
habits and interests.  
 
 
 
       


## Page 125

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 125 2. In-Market Audiences:  
You can r each users based on their recent purchase intent or past 
purchases . 
 
 
3. Demographic Audiences 
You can reach users by Reach users based on long -term life facts . 
 
 


## Page 126

John Mulry 
 
 
 126 4. Custom Affinity Audiences 
You can create your own affinity or interest audiences.  
 
 
5. Custom Intent Audiences  
You can create your own intent or purchase behavior audiences.  
 
   


## Page 127

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 127 6. Custom URL Affinity Audiences  
You can create audiences based on the URLs they visit. Target people 
who are visiting your competitors’ websites.  
 
 
7. Super URL Targeting Audiences  
This is one of super audiences we create. You can create audiences of 
people visiting the login pages of your competitors sites  
 
 
   
8. Custom App Affinity Audiences 


## Page 128

John Mulry 
 
 
 128 You can create audiences based on the types of apps they have on their 
phone.  
 
 
9. Custom Data Audiences  
You can create audiences or people who have visited your website, 
certain website pages, your YouTube channel visits, YouTube channel subscribers, video viewers and more.  
 


## Page 129

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 129 With cold traffic campaigns, we usually start with either the In -Market 
audiences that Google has created, ones we create ourselves or the URL 
affinity audiences.  
 Our goal isn’t necessarily to find just one winning audience, or campaign, our goal is maximum number of sales within our CPA target. 
 So, what we usually end up with is a basket of multiple campaigns.  
 This enables us to take advantage of the portfolio strategy.  
 When investing in stocks, you have a better chance of success when you invest in a basket of stocks vs just one stock.  
 It’s the same here, once you have winning creative but now, you’re 
running them across a basket of campaigns with different audience 
types (like the ones outlined above) you have a better chance of success 
than if you had one campaign with one audience type, or one campaign with multiple a udience types.  
 You’re spreading the risk across multiple campaigns. So, if 1 or 2 campaigns perform poorly one day, you might have 3,4,5,6 or more campaigns that perform well and you look at the overall blended results.  
 This portfolio or basket of campaign strategy works even better when you have the seven campaign odds enhancers activated.

 130 YouTube Ads Campaign Odds Enhancers  
 Ok so let’s say we have your creatives dialed and we have your audiences dialed, but we still want to optimize your media performance 
even more.  This is where our campaign odds enhancers come in.  
 These are tactical changes or creative tweaks we make to your campaigns if they are already existing or nuance to how we setup your campaign for optimal performance.  
 Odds Enhancer 1:  Shot Location(s) 
 Record your six hooks/openings in different locations.  
 Instead of recording your hooks all in the one location e.g. in front of your computer, it’s a great idea to mix them up and record them in 
different locations.  
 
For example, you could record:  
 
• In your office  
• In your kitchen  
• In your car  
• Out walking  
• With a greenscreen  
• On location (at event, mastermind etc .) 

## Page 131

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 131  
This keeps your openings fresh and different and if people see your ads 
multiple times and they are in different locations they won’t have the “oh I’ve already seen this ” thought and may be less likely to tune out.  
 Odds Enhancer 2:  Editing  
 Leverage call outs, burned in captions, quick cuts and graphics in your video ads.  
 When we first create our ads, we prioritize talking head style videos in 
our YouTube Ads as it’s what’s most native to organic YouTube videos.  
 But something else we’ve picked up and leveraged from Rich Schefren is how proper editing can lead to higher view rates and CTRs.  
 
Rich gave a presentation at TOP ONE, our sister business’ mastermind 
and he shared that some of the best performing video ads had shot lengths of 1.93 seconds.  
 This means that every 1.93 seconds something happens in the video to switch up the shot, whether it’s a graphic on screen, a different angle, something to keep the brain engaged, and focused on watching the video.  
 After hearing this, I went back and looked at our most successful ads and realized they all had fast cuts, callouts or changes on screen every 1-2 seconds, so we leverage this in all our new videos now.

 132 Odds Enhancer 3: Exclude Video Partners and Display Network  
 You used to be able to exclude video partners (mobile apps), display network when running conversion campaigns but Google have removed this option.  
 
 
The reason why we don’t want to show in video apps or on the display network is they are not conducive to skippable in stream video ads. 
 And we’ve found them to be wasted ad spend  and generally the traffic 
from them is not as high quality than from YouTube itself.  
 Thankfully, we can get around this and manually exclud e these after 
you publish your campaign.  Click into the Campaign you want to edit and then on the left -hand side 
you’ll see the tab: “Audiences, keywords and content ”. 
 


## Page 133

 133 Click “Content” and from here , click “Edit Exclusions”  on the right -hand 
side of your screen.  
 
 
 
You want to click the radio button “Add Placement Exclusion”  and tap 
Enter . 
 Here you going to type in two exclusions.  
 
1. mobileappcategory::69500  
 
This excludes all mobile apps.  
2. googleadsense_without_youtube.com  
 This excludes Google Display ads  
Odds Enhancer 4: Exclude TV

 134  
When running skippable in stream YouTube ads we want them to run 
on desktop, mobile and maybe tablet. We do not want to run them on TV screens.  
 But by default, your ads will show on all devices,  so you need to 
manually change this to remove TV screens.  
 
In the Campaign Settings under Additional Settings  is Devices . It’s here 
where you can remove TV screens.  
 Now, if you wanted to, you could test running on TV screens in a separate campaign with a very specific ad scripted and recorded for TV asking them to whip out their phone and scan a QR code etc. but in your main campaigns always exclude TV.

 135 Odds Enhancer 5: Cap View Frequency Not Impressions  
 
In your Google ads we also have the option of capping impressions or capping views. We never want to cap impressions, but we do cap views. View f requency is the number of times a user saw your ad over a given 
time. 
 
 By setting a views  cap, you can limit the number of times ads in a 
campaign get a view or interaction from the same user. Views of the same ad that’s used in other campaigns will also count towards this cap.  
 A view is counted when someone watches 30 seconds of your video ad (or the duration if it's shorter than 30 seconds) or interacts with the ad, 
whichever comes first.

 136 Odds Enhancer 6: Dig For The Gold 
 
 
 One are about YouTube Ads I love compared to Meta is you can really dig into the data and find WHERE you ads are running, what channels 
they are running on as well as how those channels are performing in relation to your KPI’s.  
 See a channel getting you a lot of conversions?  
 We might create ads specific to that channel or audience speaking directly to them.  
 Or we might create a new campaign or create a new audience with just 
that channel to see if we can drive more conversions.  
There is so much gold buried in your ad’s dashboard, it’s simply about 
taking the time to dig into it to find it. 


## Page 137

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 137  
It’s the same when to comes to the audiences you are targeting. You can 
see which audiences are performing the best, which ones are 
underperforming, which ones may have potential for scale in standalone campaigns and so much more.  There is so much gold i n your ad data just waiting for someone to mine 
it.  Ok, we have covered a LOT in the last few chapters when it comes to optimizing your media buying performance.  
 It’s time to shift gears and now look at the steps we take in optimizing your campaign performance.

 138 Optimizing Campaign Performance  
  In this chapter we’re going to through all the stages of optimizing your 
campaigns performance. Remember the example funnel we used had 
five steps.  
 
 
 Let’s say you identify your optin rate as being low.  
 Here are the steps we take to begin by working on the steps you take 
when you want to fix  low opt- in rate.  
 Congruency:  The very first thing you want to confirm is if the opt- in 
page  is congruent with your ad creative. 
 Often the cause of a low opt -in rate can be where there is incongruence 
between what's said in the ad and what is presented on the landing page.  
 You don't want a prospect to feel like they clicked on your ad , expecting 
one thing, and then they land on a page,  and they're being told about 
something else. When in doubt, use the  same overarching angles, 


## Page 139

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 139 promises and benefit statements from your ad creatives on  your opt -in 
page.  
Message : If your ads and your optin page are congruent, the next thing 
we look at testing is your meassage, starting with your main headline. 
Here instead of trying to change a couple of words within the headline 
(verbs adjectives etc.) write a different headline with a fresh angle  
altogether . 
 One thing we always go back to in copy (of any kind)  is the four U’s 
from Bob Bly.  
 
• Useful  
• Unique  
• Urgent  
• Ultra Specific  
 Is your copy useful? Is it valuable? Is it presenting something unique your market has not seen or heard before? Is it urgent and does it warrant a response now? Is it ultra specific or is it full of vague generalities?  Obviously, I cannot cover the ins and outs of copy here in this book, but here are some recommendations if you want to go deeper into the 
subject of copy  and crafting marketing messages:  
 
• The E5 Method, How to Find Your  Big Marketing Idea - Todd Brown  
• Breakthrough Advertising – Eugene Schwartz 
• The Copywriters Handbook  – Bob Bly 
• Take Their Money  – Kyle Milligan  

## Page 140

John Mulry 
 
 
 140 • Win Your Case  – Gerry Spence  
Copy/Page Length  and Layout:  
Other ways we look at improving the optin rate is by testing both copy length, page length and layout. Below are three examples of optin pages 
we are either running or have run in the past. All long form optin pages.  
 
 
 


## Page 141

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 141 We have tested a lot of various optin pages, page styles, short form pages 
with just a headline and a button versus long form pages and we’ve 
found at scale long form optin pages to be vastly outperforming short form pages.  
 Not just in terms of optin rate. But also, in terms of scalability of ads. The platforms scan your landing pages and pages with longer copy mean they have more to work with to match up your pages with the perfect audience.   
 That’s not to say don’t test short form. Always test, because your market may be different. You can test short form pages where you reduce the 
copy on the optin page to the bare minimum. Meaning if you've got 
extra bullets, and long form  copy on page, strip it down to the headline 
and just the, the call to action . 
 
Test the call to action as a form instead of a popup or vice versa or test a 
different style page altogether. Change the look and feel of the page.  
 And always optimize for mobile devices first as roughly 80% of your traffic will be from mobile devices.  Ok, let’s assume now your optin page is no longer your constraint and for every 100 clicks you get from your ads 25%+ people are opting in  but 
not enough of those leads are going from your sales page to your order form.  Which means your sales page is now your constraint. So how do we fix your sales page when you have a low sales conversion rate.  

## Page 142

John Mulry 
 
 
 142 Of course, this is super easy when you are using a video sales letter. It’s 
one of the reasons we like VSLs as a sales vehicle because we can look at 
the analytics in Wistia, Vidalytics, Vimeo (or whatever platform you’re using to host your videos) to see where the drop- off point is.  
 Like I shared a few chapters back, when looking at the analytics of a VSL 
we can clearly see where the drop off is.  
 
 
 Is it in the lead (the first 300 -400 words or the opening of the copy)? Is it 
in the argument? Is it in the transition to the offer or is it in the offer?  
 


## Page 143

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 143  
 
Once we've identified the drop -off point, it's a matter of tweaking and 
testing. And what you're tweaking is that drop -off point. So,  you're 
tweaking the lead.  
 Now if you’re not using a VSL what can you do? This is much harder to do on long form sales page or a hybrid sales page that has both video and long form copy.  
 It can be done. It just might take you longer.  Now, typically on a long 
form page people will generally read your headline and sub headline, then scroll all the way down to your offer to see the offer, the price point, the proposition, deliverables etc.  
 
For us, we start with the offer . We  take a long hard look at everything 
that makes up the offer.  Is it a SIN offer? Is it a  superior irresistible no 
brainer offer? How many of the eight SIN offer elements does it have?  
 
9 Essentials To Every Offer:  
 
• Quick and e asy to implement.  
• Produces f ast results 
• Viewed as new and d ifferent 
• Superior to o thers  
• Solves significant problem or unfulfilled desire. 
• Can be positioned or partly positioned as done for you.  


## Page 144

John Mulry 
 
 
 144 • Gives p rospects c onfidence/ hope 
• Has an attractive solution  
 There is one other element to a SIN offer that’s more relevant to you than 
the prospect buying it, is:  
 
• Does it have a natural alignment to an exciting upsell 
 This is massive and we will cover more on this very shortly as well as expanded on this further in coming chapters . 
 Assuming the offer is a SIN offer we then look at testing lead which is 
the opening 300 -500 words of the copy. Then the argument, then the 
transition. When it comes to testing the lead, w e would test a different 
lead completely . We would switch up the first 300 -500 words with a 
different angle, hook or idea altogether.  
 If you haven’t read the book Great Leads by John Forde and Michael 
Masterson,  I highly recommend it.  I had the opportunity to interview 
John a couple years ago alongside Todd Brown, and he’s an absolute gentleman and one of the most successful copywriters alive today.  
 In Great Leads,  John and Michael break down the different lead types and 
themes. Essentially there are direct leads and indirect leads.  A direct 
lead is  when it’s clear in your copy you’ re presenting an offer . An 
indirect lead is when it’s less apparent from your copy you’re presenting 
an offer. 

## Page 145

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 145  
Generally, you use direct leads when you’re speaking to people higher 
up the levels of awareness and more indirect leads the lower you go down the levels of awareness.  The eight lead types are as follows:   
 
 Offer Lead:

 149 Now let's move on to optimizing your order form when it’s your 
constraint. 
 
 
 We start by looking at the order from a tech point of view. Is the order form actually working? Did you do a test purchase? It sounds trivial but unfortunately it happens.  
 After that we look at how the order form displays on both mobile and on desktop to ensure nothing is hidden or missing from mobile.  
 
Assuming everything is working from a tech point of view we can start 
to look at testing different elements on the order form.  How much contact information are we asking for? Can we test just a skeleton order form asking for basic information like just name, email credit card info?   
 Depending on your price -point you may need to capture full 
information so be sure to check first.  
 Now, if you have a skeleton order form  already , you might want to 
expand and test adding elements like affirmation copy , offer specific 
testimonials, unannounced bonuses, security images, a mobile only

 150 button at the very bottom of the page that brings them back to the top, 
countdown timers, exit pops, or test a two-step checkout process. 
 
Here's an example of a  style of  order form page we’ve tested for multiple 
offers that always does really well for us.  
 
 


## Page 151

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 151 Here are some examples of specific order form elements you could test 
on your order form.  
 
Affirmation Copy: 
 
Affirmation copy is at the top of the page where  you're restating the core 
benefits of the offer for your prospect and you're doing it in their voice.  
 It's written in the prospect's voice, but it recaps the core benefit, the core 
promise, and end result of the o ffer. 
  A Countdown Timer:  


## Page 152

John Mulry 
 
 
 152  
Here’s  a simple example of a 15-minute  countdown timer at the top of 
an order form that can add to create more urgency.  
 Exit Pop:  
 
Here’s an example of an exit pop that appears when somebody goes to 
abandon the order form that just says something like, wait, don't leave yet, you've not completed your order.  


## Page 153

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 153 Two Step Checkout:  
 
 
Here’s an example of a two-step checkout process . Here instead of 
sending people directly to the order form from the button or buttons on your sales page you have a popup where they enter their name, email (and maybe phone number) and then you bring them to the order form to complete their checkout.  
 This can o ftentimes this increases order form completion rate.  
 On top of that, it can also improve overall sales because you have the ability to follow up with these people via email, text, phone call etc. and 
convert more prospects into sales. We’ll be discussing things like follow -
up, abandon carts and monetization windows in future chapters, for now let's talk about fixing low upsell conversion rate.  
 


## Page 154

John Mulry 
 
 
 154  
Fixing upsell take rate is made up of two areas: 
• Your upsell offer  
• How you present your upsell offer  
 First and foremost, questions we ask related to the offer when looking 
at optimizing the upsell page are:   
 How congruent is your upsell to your main offer ?  
 
Is it even relevant to them? How much thought was put into it or is it 
being offered just because you have it lying around.  
 
Does it align with your front -end offer ? 
 Does it help your prospect get the result faster? Does it make things easier for them? Does it help get them a get a different result? Does it solve a different result that comes up now they bought your front -end? 
 Next , we look at the offer type. Is it a hard offer ? Meaning it’s an offer 
that they must pay today to get access to.  Is it a soft offer? Meaning, do 
they access to it today for free and pay only if they’re delighted after a certain time period. For example: “Try free for the next 7 days and then 


## Page 155

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 155 it’s only one payment of $97, but only if you’re delighted”. Or is it a 
payment plan offer, or maybe a paid trial offer.  
After offer type, we look at the price -point of the offer. Can we test a 
different price -point. This is a big lever that can radically increase the 
conversion rate on the upsell.  
 
Now like we discussed a few chapters back; you are not just looking at upsell conversion rate but also AOV contribution. You always want to prioritize AOV contribution over upsell conversion rate.  We will be covering all the different ways to increase AOV  in the coming chapters 
and will dive deep into AOV contribution in these pages.  
 Finally, after price you can test the format of how you present your upsell page. We usually test blinded pages versus unblinded page.  
 Here’s a blind upsell page:  
 


## Page 156

John Mulry 
 
 
 156 A blind upsell page is an upsell page where there is  no indication on the 
page that there is an offer being presented. It might just be a thank you headline and button that’s it.  The offer portion of the upsell and ability 
to upgrade is hidden until the offer is revealed in the video.  An unblinded page is simply a typical long form sales page with the offer, and button to upgrade visible from the outset  
 And then finally change the format. And what I mean here is change the format at which you're delivering the upsell presentation.

 157 Optimizing Economic Performance  
 
 
 
Now let's talk about fixing the economic  performance of your paid 
advertising.   This area is my favorite of all because it’s where you have the biggest advantage. It’s also one of our superpowers at the E5Agency.  
 Sure,  we know how optimize ad campaigns and creatives  for your offers 
(as we should ), but the real scale is unlocked is in the economics side of 
your business . 
 No amount of media optimization, and campaign optimization can make up for poor economics.  Meaning it really doesn’t matter how good 
your ads are doing and how well your pages are converting if your economics stink.  The five parts of economic performance are split into 
two phases and are as follows. 
 
Phase 1: AOV Optimzation  


## Page 158

John Mulry 
 
 
 158  
Part 1: Increase the # number of transaction maximization offers  
Part 2: Increase performance of the transaction maximization offers  
Part 3: Test different transaction maximization offer price- points  
Part 4: Test different core offer price -points  
 
Phase 2: Monetization Windows  
 Part 5: Lengthen or expand your monetization window.  
 The first four phases are all about increasing your average order value and are all interconnected the last phase is all about your monetization 
window. More on that later. But I’ll say this to whet your appetite.  
 It gives you a massive and I mean massive competitive advantage if you implement it and your ability to scale your offers becomes a matter of 
when, not if.  
 
For now , let’s focus on the first four parts. 
 Increasing average order value is about getting your front -end buyers to 
spend more money with you, on the day they become a buyer.  

## Page 159

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 159  
When you break it down, fixing the media performance and campaign 
performance is all about decreasing CPA . Meaning if you have a low 
LCTR, a high CPC, a low optin rate, low sales conversion rate, and low 
order form completion rate, all of those things will cause your CPA to 
go up.  
 But what if all of those things are working? M eaning your media is 
operating the way it needs to , and your campaign performance is 
operating the way it needs to , well then , the CPA is the CPA.  
 What happens when all of those things are performing as they should, but your campaign is still not viable (in relation to your LAA)?  This is 
where you need to look at the other side of the coin.  You need to increase the amount of money you are collecting, on average from every 
customer you generate, the day they become a customer.  In a future 
chapter we’re going to dive deep into the tactical elements of increasing 
AOV but for now I want to walk you through the strategic elements of 
what you need to do wo  increase AOV.  


## Page 160

John Mulry 
 
 
 160  
Part 1: Increase the # number of transaction maximization offers.  
Transaction maximization offers are additional offers your buyers see 
when they buy your front- end offer. I want to give you two examples of 
how we go about adding TMO’s. The first is a basic funnel flow we like to use and the second is a more advanced funnel flow  for when we are 
going all out to maximize AOV.  
 Basic AOV Maximization Funnel Flow  
 
With the Basic AOV maximization funnel flow you have  four areas for 
AOV contribution.  
 
• Your main offer  
• An order form bump  offer  
• An upsell offer  
• A downsell offer  
 
Advanced  AOV Maximization Funnel Flow 


## Page 161

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 161  
 
With the Advanced AOV maximization funnel flow you have up to ELEVEN areas for AOV contribution.  
 
• Your main offer  
• Order form upgrade offer  
• Order form bump offer 1 
• Order form bump offer 2  
• Upsell 1 offer  
• Downsell 1 offer  
• Upsell 2 offer  
• Downsell 2 offer  
• Upsell 3 offer  
• Downsell 3 offer  
• Thank You Page Gift Offer  
 
This is obviously a beast of a funnel flow and is not always necessary. 
And we only ever do what’s necessary to make the paid advertising 


## Page 162

John Mulry 
 
 
 162 work. And increasing AOV is generally much easier than lowering CPA 
(improving media performance and campaign performance).  
 
 
 To be clear, I’m not saying you should always strive for having the Advanced AOV Maximization Funnel Flow  in place. It’s does, however, 
show you the magnitude of the optimization available to you on the AOV and economic side of things. Ok so how should you go about increasing your AOV with additional TMO’s?  
 We generally start with the Basic AOV Maximization Funnel Flow  or a 
light version of it. You’ll begin by adding a bump offer, an upsell offer 
and maybe downsell offer.  
 Now you can add all of these at once but it’s not necessary. We typically add one at a time or if we know our economics are off by a lot, meaning 


## Page 163

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 163 we have to significantly increase AOV we might add both the bump and 
upsell (and maybe a downsell) at the same time. 
 
The mechanics of these I’ll talk about in future chapter. Once you add your TMO’s you then run some more paid advertising to get data and find out how much they are contributing and increasing AOV.  
 What you’re looking to see is if adding the TMO’s fixes the CPA to AOV 
ratio (in relation to your LAA) .  
 Now, if it does not  you move onto Part  2. 
 Part 2: Increase performance of the transaction maximization offers  
 Here you work on optimizing the bump offer , the upsell  (and possibly 
the downsell if you implemented one) , meaning you want to look at 
increasing the conversion rates , and the take rates  on those TMO’s.  
 Part 3: Test different transaction maximization offer price- points  
 Now, if you increase the conversion rate on your TMO’s, and it still does 
not fix the CPA to AOV  ratio, then you want to test higher prices on your 
TMO’s.  
 Part 4: Test different core offer price -points  
 What if this still doesn’t fix your CPA to AOV ratio? You move to p art 4 
and you test a higher price on your main offer.  

## Page 164

John Mulry 
 
 
 164 Now we want this to always be the last step of Phase 1 because by testing 
a higher price  can have a negative impact on sales conversion rate.  
Meaning , if we test a higher price on our TMO’s.  that in no way impacts 
the sales conversion rate  of our main offer.  
 It doesn’t impact the  number  of buyers we're acquiring, because it's not 
touching the front end  offer in our campaign. It's not touching the front 
end of the campaign, right?  
 Now,  one thing to mention is a decrease in sales conversion rate may be 
worth it. You need to make the trade -off willingly allowing for a 
decrease in sales conversion rate , if it allows you to increase your 
average order value.  
 Let me give you an extreme example  to illustrate .  
 
Let's say you have a 10% sales conversion rate on a $50 offer.  
 
Now let's say we raise the price to $500 and now your sales conversion 
rate drops to 2%.  
 The reality is,  if that was the only product you were selling , by raising it 
price to $500, we automatically raise our AOV to $500. Whereas the $50 
offer our AOV is going to be $50. If that $50 is not enough to pay for  your 
paid advertising , then I'd rather you have a 2% sales conversion rate on 
an AOV that does allow you to run paid advertising than a  10% sales 
conversion rate on an AOV that doesn't allow you to run paid 
advertising. 

## Page 165

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 165  
Essentially in Part 4 of Phase 1, we manipulate price but do so knowing 
it may bring down the sales conversion rate  in process. It may also 
elevate the CPA as well, but done right, we can offset that decrease in sales conversion rate and increase in CPA with enough of an AOV  
increase to hit your  CPA to AOV targets.  
 Phase 2: Monetization Windows  
 Part 5: Lengthen or expand your monetization window.  
 This is something very few people are aware of let alone action, but it can have a massive impact on your ability to scale your business with paid advertising.  
 The first phase we discussed above is all about playing an economic 
game rather than a marketing /media performance game when it comes 
to acquiring buyers and doing it in mass at scale.  The second phase 
brings it to a whole other level.  
  

## Page 166

John Mulry 
 
 
 166 Rigging the Game With the Monetization Window  
 
 
The whole concept of monetization window was first shared with me by Todd Brown at one of our TOP ONE Mastermind meeting’s in Florida.  
 Ever since, I’ve been fascinated with it  and something I’ve been pouring 
into.  
 I see Phase 2 of E conomic Performance as a whole other economic lever 
we can pull to stack the paid advertising odds in your favor.  
 Now,  typically when we talk about the value of a new buyer, we’re 
referring to the day the become a buyer, which we refer to as Day 0.  
 But when we use a n extended  monetization window , it changes the 
game significantly.  It changes the economics, the math , and the  numbers 
that we use to scal e. 
 


## Page 167

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 167 Typically, when you’re driving paid ads to acquire buyers, most people 
are looking at it from the point of view  of this one funnel or marketing 
campaign they’re sending traffic to.  
 
They’re also looking at their results through the lens of just this one funnel and marketing campaign.  Let’s say they’re LAA is Level 2: 
Breakeven. In judging the effectiveness of their campaigns, they’re 
asking themselves:   “Are we breaking even on our ad spend  to this funnel  or not?”  
 So, when they're looking at their monetization window, they're looking 
at it purely from the point of view  of within this one funnel or marketing 
campaign.   
 Whereas , the savviest, biggest and most profitable direct response 
businesses look to at their results over a lengthened m onetization 
window,  that contains MULTIPLE funnels, and campaigns.  
 Imagine this scenario.  
 You have two entrepreneurs, in the same niche, running paid advertising to acquire new customers.   

## Page 168

John Mulry 
 
 
 168  
 One of the entrepreneurs  has given themselves one funnel  and three 
days of follow- up to be able to pay for the acquisition of a customer,   and 
recoup their ad spen d.  
 Now imagine you’re the other entrepreneur.   
 You’re savvy and you understand the economic game of paid advertising.  
 
Instead of limiting yourself to just one funnel and three days, you’ve given yourself multiple  funnels and 30 days to be able to pay for the 
acquisition of  customers and to recoup your ad spend. 
 Or lets illustrate this with an extreme example of five funnels and 30  
days. Five may sound like a lot but I’ll share a relatively easy way of 
implementing this shortly.

Who's got the advantage?  Who's got the leverage?   
 
Who's got the better opportunity  of making those economics work?   
 The one entrepreneur who's got one funnel and three days or, you the 
savvy entrepreneur, who has got multiple  and 30 days.  
 The answer is obvious and so it should be.  
 You, the savvy entrepreneur, are ultimately going to be able to outspend your competition and truly be able to spend the most to acquire customers, because you’ve got multiple  funnels and 30 days.  
 Or as they say in baseball, y ou’ve got more swings at the ba t. As an aside 
one of my favorite movies is Moneyball . There are so many great lessons

 170 in Moneyball that can be applied to paid advertising, marketing and 
business.  
 
With a lengthened monetization window you have more 
opportunities  to monetize unconverted buyers from funnel  one, funnel 
two and funnel three.  You also have the ability to further monetize buyers  from all three 
funnels too . 
 Now there is no magic number in three funnels. I’m just using three as an example. You might have three, four or five funnels you use in your monetization window but bottom line it if you’re just using one funnel 
to and a shorter monetization window you’re severely limiting your ability to scale.  
 
Unfortunately, the majority of online entrepreneurs look at customer 
acquisition   with paid advertising through the lens of one campaign .  
 
It’s like they’re thinking (either consciously or subconsciously):  
 “This is my acquisition funnel. I'm putting all the weight , all the focus on this  
one funnel  to do the complete job of acquiring new buyers  at a rate and a  
value that will allow me to pay for my advertising. ” 
 The reality is, there is no rule in business that says you must operate this way. The paid advertising game  isn't won or lost based on whether

 171 you're able to acquire new buyers  and pay for your ad spend with one 
funnel,  versus two funnels,  three funnels or more .  
There's no award given to you if you are able to make it work within 
three days of thirty days. 
 Remember what I said at the very beginning of this book?  
 You are investing in the acquisition of assets (customers) who have a cost today, a value today and a future value.  
 What the majority of online entrepreneurs who leverage paid advertising to acquire customers are really doing  is looking at the value 
of their investments , and making inferior decisions,  based on a 
restrictive, pre -determined period of time.  
 They're making an investment today , and looking at the value  of that 
investment today.  They're not giving themselves enough time or doing 
what needs to be done in order for the investment to play out the way they want.  
 With a lengthened  monetization window,  you’re  giving yourself more 
time  to further monetize prospects with additional funnels and offers .  
 It makes paid advertising infinitely easier to acquire buyers  than if 
you're reliant on solely one funnel and a shorter time period like one 
day, three days or whatever.  
 When you’re leveraging a longer monetization window with multiple funnels, you’re playing a far superior game than every one else, you’re

 172 rigging the game in your favor your ability to scale with paid 
advertising becomes that much easier.  While everyone else is playing a performance game, you’re miles above them. You’re playing an economic game or an OfferNomics game.  Listen if you take nothing else away from this book, realize this.  
 Business is a game of economics. Business is economics. It's not a game 
of marketing performance.   In other words, at the end of the day,  if the 
economics of your paid advertising work,  I don't care  what  your 
marketing performance metrics are.  
 It’s taken me a long time to realise this. And I credit Todd for instilling the economic performance mindset into me. It didn’t happen overnight however.  
 For the longest time I was the marketing performance guy. The media 
performance guy. Priding myself and being enamoured with my ability to get crazy high conversion rates on campaigns and funnels.  
 Heck, I even have a championship belt for having the highest converting campaign in the history of campaigns we ran.

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 173 Now,  admittedly, that belt is kind of 
cool and it sits all shiny, behind me in 
my office, today it serves as a different symbol.   It serves as a reminder, that, at the end 
of the day if the economics of your 
paid advertising stink, it doesn’t 
matter how great the media performance and marketing performance is.  
  
Something else to understand is this.  
 When you operate from the  investor mindset,  playing an economic 
game , you’re  ultimately leveraging paid advertising to acquire 
customers that are worth more to you than what it is that you’re  paying 
for them.  
 What is not mentioned in that statement above?  
 There is no mention of the amount of funnels it should  take you or the 
amount of time it should take you.  
 You don’t have to do it with just one funnel or within 24 hours or anything like that.

 174 Those are just arbitrary constrictions . They are  constraints you’ve likely 
placed on yourself for whatever reason,  maybe unconscious 
conditioning from being the one funnel away  mentality or conditioning 
because of being stuck in a performance mentality.  
 So how many funnels should you use and how long should your monetization window be?  
 Before we dive into this, when I say multiple funnels, I’m not saying you need to have multiple funnels with different products.  
 You can have multiple funnels all promoting the same offer. Each funnel would just use a different delivery mechanism.  
 
For example, funnel one might use a VSL,  funnel two a book, funnel 
three a webinar, funnel four a long form sales letter, and funnel five 


## Page 175

OFFERNOMICS  
 
 175 another VSL. They are all promoting the same offer. The only difference 
is in the vehicle you use to promote thew offer.  
Another way of using multiple funnels and a longer monetization 
window is keeping the delivery mechanism the same but switching up the lead type you’re using. We covered the eight different lead types earlier, remember? 
 
 


## Page 176

For example, funnel one use the problem solution lead. Funnel two could be use an offer lead. Funnel three could leverage an invitation lead. In funnel four, you could have a promise lead and in funnel five, you could use a story lead.  
 Another way to use multiple funnel is to come up with different variations of your offer.  
 


## Page 177

Funnel one might have a hard offer or your core offer as is. Funnel two a soft offer (e.g. free for 3 days then just $X). Funnel three might be a lighter version of your offer (e.g. strip out the first part or most exciting 
part of your deliverable and sel l on its own for reduced price). Funnel 
four may be a slack adjusting funnel with a higher ticket variation of 
your offer (e.g. a done for you version). And funnel five could be a mid -
ticket version of your offer. When you roll out a second funnel, third funnel etc.  to your unconverted 
prospects,   every additional buyer   not only brings in revenue,  but it also 
brings down your customer acquisition costs.  
 You already paid for the traffic, you paid for the leads and you paid for the initial buyers from the first funnel.   Now, with your additional funnels, when you further monetize those 
prospects  with a dditional funnel , you're bringing down your cost per 


## Page 178

 178 acquisition.  You're not spending more on traffic.  You're just turning 
more of that traffic into revenue.  
 This completely changes the game for you economically.  
 Here’s an example that should really drive this home for you.  
 Let’s say your first funnel  brings you in 500 leads and 5 0 buyers. And it 
cost you $10 a lead. So you spent $5,000, and your current CPA is $100.  
 Now you have a second funnel that brings you in an additional 50 buyers from the remaining 450 leads, what happens to your CPA now?  
 It’s been slashed by HALF.  It’s now $5,000 / 100 buyers = $50. 
 Then if you roll out a third funnel  for the remaining 400 unconverted 
leads and convert another 50, your CPA comes down to $33. 
 On top of that, every additional buyer obviously brings in more revenue so with an extended optimization window you simply make more 
money.  
 You're changing the economics  of your paid advertising.  You're not only 
bringing in more revenue, you're decreasing your costs. 
 This is what OFFERNOMICS is all about.

 179 Like I said, there  is no rule  that says you have to acquire buyers  with a 
single funnel and you have to do it in a set period of time. And there’s 
certainly no reward for it.  
 The reality is, when it comes to paid advertising for new customer acquisition, most entrepreneurs give up too soon. They expect to make 
it happen from just one campaign and they expect it to happen the same day they invest in their traffic.  It nearly never happens that way. Yes, everything we discussed in this 
book takes time, effort, money and expertise to make work.  
 And a lot of times it isn’t fun. That’s just the reality. Business isn’t always fun. If it was, everyone and their grandma would be  succeeding but 
they’re not.  
At the end of the day, when I look at scaling your business with paid 
advertising I ask myself this question.  
 If my client  had one funnel  that I had to make  work to bring in enough 
buyers,  in order to make the cost of their  paid advertising viable or if they had 
three funnels, which would be easier ? 
 Sure, it may be harder to set all of this up, it may take some extra time 
and effort, but which is going to be easier to scale?  
 Hopefully the answer is clear to you.

 180 Rather than merely looking at your acquisition costs on day zero from a 
single funnel , you can now set up an acquisition window  of multiple 
funnels and watch how your CPA comes down over time.   
 If it requires more work,  more funnels,  and a larger monetization 
window,  so be it.

 181 Concluding Thoughts…  
 
We have covered quite a lot in this short (but hopefully valuable ) 
book. It all began with the initial chapters on frontend and backend 
monetization.  
 
From there we moved into the different levels of acquisition 
aggression, marketing performance metrics and financial performance metrics.  
 
Following that, we dove deep into the areas of identifying and fixing your campaign constraints and covered the three levers of optimization 
in media performance, campaign performance and economic performance.  
 My hope in writing this book was to open your eyes to what’s 
possible when you play a different game than everyone else with your paid ads.  
 A game not just of media performance and campaign performance, but one of economic performance too.  
 
You’ve invested in this book and you’ve consumed what’s inside these pages but your biggest  advantage comes from  action.  
 As I said at the very beginning: Knowing without doing is the same as not 
knowing.

 182 Whether you decide to implement all of this yourself, have your team 
do it, have  us do it  for you, I don’t mind as long as you start 
implemented what you’ve read in these pages.   
 
Now, o f course I would love the opportunity to show you how  we at  the 
E5 Agency can just take this off your plate do it all for you.  
 I’m not going to go into a long -drawn- out sales pitch for our services.  
 You’ve likely already made up your mind at this stage if you’d be 
interested in finding out,  if we would be a good fit to work together.   
 If that’s the case, you can simply go to E5Agency.com and schedule a zoom call and speak with me personally.   
 We don’t have a sales team, and we don’t do any hard pitching or 
anything like that. It’s simply not our style.  
 
Our agency is a small boutique agency, and we generally only onboard 1-2 clients per month.  On this call, we are going to do two things:  
 
1. We’ll look at your acquisition goals, your offer, your ad campaigns, your funnel and your economics. We’ll help you identify what your current constraint is and biggest opportunity to move the needle.  
2. Next, we’ll map out an action plan of exactly what we would do if it were us scaling your campaigns for you as well as detail the 
ins and outs of working with us .
