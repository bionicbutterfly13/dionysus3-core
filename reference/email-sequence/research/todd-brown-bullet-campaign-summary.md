# Todd Brown Bullet Campaign System Summary

## Core Concept

A "bullet campaign" is a simple evergreen email campaign you set up once and can deploy ("fire") whenever you want to generate cash flow from your house file (existing email list).

**Mantra:** More offers, more frequently, without burning out your house file.

---

## Three Core Components

### 1. Marketing & Sales Vehicle
- VSL, long-form sales letter, short-form sales letter, webinar replay
- Doesn't matter which - whatever suits your strength
- This is where you deliver the E5 marketing message and offer

### 2. Two-Step Email Sequence
- **Interest/Click Sequence** → identifies who's interested
- **Conversion/Offer Sequence** → turns interested prospects into buyers

### 3. Dynamic Deadline
- 3-day deadline that starts when they FIRST visit the sales page
- Not a fixed date - each person gets their own countdown
- This is why sales trickle in for weeks after firing

---

## The Interest/Click Sequence

**Purpose:** Lead generate out of your house file

**Structure:**
- 3 days
- 2 emails per day (8:30am and 8:30pm)
- 6 total emails

**Email Style:**
- Teaser/lift note style
- Short (~150 words)
- Disruption, intrigue about topic, call to action
- NOT about the offer - about the VALUE of consuming the marketing page

**Critical Rule: NOT Completely Blind**
> "The point is to identify who is interested in the topic. I don't want to keep the emails completely blind just to generate a click... my aim is not to generate as much curiosity as I can. I don't want the click coming from pure curiosity because it defeats the whole purpose."

They should know the TOPIC they're clicking to learn about. Completely blind = unqualified clicks = burns out list.

**What Happens:**
- If they click ANY link → immediately taken out, go to sales page, dropped into Conversion Sequence
- If they don't click after 3 days → removed from campaign entirely, never see the offer

**Finding Different Angles:**
- Email 1: Overall promise
- Email 2: The hook
- Email 3: One nugget/gem from the video
- Email 4: Problem angle
- Email 5: Authority/credibility
- Email 6: Short, direct "this is free, go here"

## The Conversion/Offer Sequence

**Purpose:** Turn interested prospects into buyers

**Structure:**
- Day 1: 2 emails (8:30am, 8:30pm) - about the offer
- Day 2: 2 emails (8:30am, 8:30pm) - about the offer
- Day 3: 4 emails (8:30am, 1:30pm, 6:30pm, 11pm) - URGENCY

**Day 1-2 Content (Formulaic):**
- Email 1: Here's what you're getting (full deliverables list)
- Email 2: The guarantee - "just say let me check it out"
- Email 3: Focus on one bonus
- Email 4: Tomorrow is deadline + benefits recap

**Day 3 Content (Urgency):**
- Email 5: Last day - full pitch
- Email 6: Only hours away
- Email 7: 3 hours left
- Email 8: 1 hour left - super short "Get it here. Enjoy. Todd."

**Key Insight:**
> "The heavy lifting is really done by the deadline. Just leverage it."

## Dynamic Deadline Mechanics

**Setup:**
- 3-day deadline (tested, sweet spot between too short and too long)
- Deadline = time remaining today + 3 full days
- Always expires at 11:59pm their time
- Triggered on FIRST VISIT to the marketing/sales page

**Why This Works:**
- Uniform experience for everyone
- Can optimize because everyone gets same messaging
- Sales continue trickling in for weeks after firing

**Example:**
- Monday 8:30am: Send interest email
- Tuesday 3pm: Prospect clicks link, visits sales page
- Tuesday 3pm: 3-day countdown starts (rest of Tuesday + Wed + Thu + Fri)
- Friday 11:59pm: Their deadline expires

**Tools:**
- Deadline Funnel
- Countdown Hero

## Key Philosophy

### Singles > Grand Slams
> "Playing the game of marketing where you're looking to constantly hit grand slams... that is a stressful endeavor. I've done it. I would not want to play that game again."

- Not everything needs to be a home run
- $40K from a bullet you set up once and fire repeatedly = winning
- If one bombs, next week there's another

### Complexity = Enemy of Scale
> "The more complex it is, the less likely you are to execute consistently."

- Simple autoresponder structure
- No elaborate tagging/segmentation
- Just: clicked or didn't click

### You Have Content
> "You've got so much stuff that you created that was valuable and potentially is still valuable. And what do we do with it? Nada."

- Podcast interviews
- YouTube videos (reformat with slides)
- Old speeches/presentations
- Modules from bigger trainings
- Internal team trainings
- Old products not actively sold

---

## Tagging Structure

**Simple:**
1. Tag: "Started [Campaign] Click Sequence"
2. Tag: "In Campaign - Do Not Mail" (when entering conversion sequence)
3. Tag: "Finished [Campaign]"
4. Remove: "In Campaign - Do Not Mail" when they exit

**Why "In Campaign - Do Not Mail":**
> "I don't want to expose people to additional messages that are going through a campaign already... I don't want to introduce any noise."

---

## Advanced Tactics

### Buyers on Bench
- Your best buyers may be excluded from multiple bullets in a row
- Send them to a DIFFERENT offer while main bullet runs
- Can have 2 bullet campaigns running simultaneously

### After Non-Clickers Finish
- Thursday through Sunday: list is "cold"
- Can send them something else
- Even a one-off broadcast, application, content piece

### Expired Page Strategy
> "Don't send people to a page that says 'this offer expired' and that's it. That becomes a dead end."

Options:
1. Redirect to another offer (dedicated sales page for expired traffic)
2. Show super signature with other offers
3. Brief "redirecting..." then new offer

### Bundle Offers
- Take 12 old products not actively sold
- Bundle for $297
- One of their top-performing bullets

---

## Creating Bullet Campaigns

### Where to Find Offers:

1. **Parts of bigger trainings** - modules that stand alone
2. **Reformatted free content** - YouTube → slides + audio → product
3. **Podcast interviews** - compile 5 into a training
4. **Old speeches/presentations** - with transcript = guide
5. **Content not being sold** - books, old products, cheat sheets
6. **Internal trainings** - team calls, SOPs, planning docs
7. **Bundles** - assemble existing products
8. **New easy-to-create products** - action guides, cheat sheets

### ICE Scoring for Prioritization
- **I**mpact - Revenue potential
- **C**onfidence - Belief it'll work, ability to execute
- **E**ase - How simple to implement

---

## Scheduling Bullets

**Target:** 45 bullets per year (almost weekly)

**Vary Price Points:**
- High ticket
- Mid-tier
- Low ticket

> "I don't want anybody who's not ready for high ticket to feel like that's all these guys offer."

**Don't Train List to Say No:**
- Mix up price points throughout month
- Activate buyers at ANY price point
- Turning prospect → buyer is hardest part

## Application to IAS Email Sequence

### Current Structure Mapping:
- **Lead Magnet Delivery (5 emails)** = Warm-up
- **Emails 1-15** = Various topics, education-based marketing
- **Emails 16-20** = Conversion-focused, driving to VSL

### Bullet Campaign Application:
- Interest Sequence could be emails teasing the VSL
- Conversion Sequence = final push to $97 tripwire
- Dynamic 3-day deadline on VSL page

### Voice Alignment:
Todd Brown's interest emails are:
- Short
- Teaser style
- Topic-revealing (not blind)
- Multiple angles on same promise

This aligns with IAS voice rules:
- 5th grade reading level
- Short lines, white space
- Sell the click, not the transformation
- Leave something unresolved

## Key Quotes

> "Why are you not giving your people the opportunity to buy every single day?"

> "Relief kills clicks. Orientation creates clicks."

> "The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing. It feels like I'm being educated."

> "Don't over agonize. Make a decision and roll with it. The best way to find out what's best is by implementing."

> "All of you can and should do this. You've got content to repurpose, you've got value to give. You've got people on your list that want to spend more money with you if you gave them the opportunity."
