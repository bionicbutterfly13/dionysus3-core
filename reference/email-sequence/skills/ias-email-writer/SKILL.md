# IAS Email Writer Skill

Write nurture emails for the Inner Architect System that sell the CLICK, not the transformation.

## Quick Start

**Input Required:**
- Email number (1-20)
- Email purpose (Connect/Reveal/Reframe/Prove/Activate)
- Subject line (sentence case)
- Framework to tease (if applicable)

**Output Location:**
`/Volumes/Arkham/Marketing/stefan/assets/IAS-email-XX-FINAL.md`

---

## VOICE RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### MUST DO
- Sentence case subject lines
- Short lines, lots of white space
- Single-line statements for emphasis
- Triple patterns: "You stop... You stop... You rebuild..."
- Bridging logic: "That's why..."
- Mid-email CTA + P.S.
- Sign-off: "Talk soon, Dr. Mani"
- **Write at 5th grade reading level**
- Sound like a person talking to another person

### MUST AVOID
- **Em dashes (ZERO allowed)** - Use periods, commas, or line breaks instead
- Title Case in subject lines
- Bro energy ("crush it," "level up," "beast mode")
- Woo language ("healing," "journey," "vulnerable," "self-care")
- Therapy-speak ("process," "holding space," "safe container")
- Hedging ("maybe," "perhaps," "might")
- Filler phrases ("Here's the uncomfortable truth")
- Checklisty phrases ("No spike. No tightening. No urge.")
- Metaphors that don't make sense at 5th grade level
- Writer-brain over human-brain

### VOCABULARY

**USE:**
- architecture, system, integration, calibration, mechanism
- signal, diagnostic, operating system, rebuilt, recalibration
- pattern, protocol, prediction, mismatch

**AVOID:**
- healing, therapy, soft, vulnerable, balance
- manifest, attract, hustle, grind
- "loses its grip," "hijacks you"
- high performers / high achievers (use HER experience instead)

---

## PRIMARY EMAIL JOB

**Emails sell the CLICK, not the transformation.**

If the email satisfies curiosity completely: it failed
If the reader feels calmer after reading: you went too far
If the reader doesn't want to click: revise

### Correct Reader State After Email
- Slightly unsettled
- Intellectually oriented
- Personally recognized
- NOT relieved

**Relief kills clicks. Orientation creates clicks.**

---

## EMAIL STRUCTURE TEMPLATE

```markdown
# Email [X]: [Short Title]

**Status:** Final
**Framework:** [Template Name]
**CTA Destination:** VSL

---

**Subject:** [sentence case subject line]

[Opening line - pattern recognition or direct observation]

[2-3 short paragraphs building tension]

[Mid-email CTA]
[Watch the full framework]

[1-2 paragraphs continuing the thought]

Talk soon,
Dr. Mani

P.S. [Unresolved hook or callback to opening]
```

## TEMPLATE SELECTION (Ninja Nurture)

| Template | When to Use | Key Element |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Problem** | Agitate pain, position solution | Name the pattern she's living |
| **Process** | Teach 3-step framework (partially) | Tease structure, don't complete it |
| **Promise** | Bold claim + framework | Make an assertion that needs proof |
| **Ping** | Short engagement, pattern interrupt | Under 150 words, one insight |
| **Proof** | Social proof through specific story | Testimonial with transformation arc |

### Template Scoring (Minimum 18/25)
1. Connection Factor (1-5): Opens with shared experience?
2. Mechanism Fit (1-5): Allows UMP/UMS integration?
3. Voice Match (1-5): Can be written calm, diagnostic?
4. Curiosity Preservation (1-5): Leaves something unresolved?
5. Avatar Specificity (1-5): Speaks to HER experience?

| 10 | Why I built this | Personal Story |
| 11 | Why pushing harder fails | MOSAEIC Mind Gym tease |
| 12 | Your track record as blind spot | Breakthrough Mapping tease |

## AVATAR: THE ANALYTICAL EMPATH

**Demographics:**
- Net worth: $1M-$5M+ liquid
- Roles: C-Suite, Founders, Surgeons, Senior Partners
- Age: 35-55
- 71% experience imposter syndrome

**The Paradox:**
She built the iron suit to survive. Underneath it beats a bleeding heart.

**The Shell:** SVP. $420K. Corner office. Ruthless negotiator. The one who holds it together.

**The Core:** Replays conversations wondering if she hurt someone. Feels the whole room before analyzing it. Absorbs others' emotions. Cares deeply while appearing detached.

**Big 3 Pain Points:**
1. **The Split Self** - Running two identities (Avatar vs. Hollow Self)
2. **The Replay Loop** - SSAR cycle (Shame > Spiral > Abandon > Restart)
3. **Hollow Success Paradox** - Have everything, feel nothing

**What She Wants:**
- Not to kill the achiever
- Not to become "soft"
- Not to dig through her past
- **Integration.** One self. The empath AND the executive.

## FRAMEWORK TEASING (NOT TEACHING)

### How to Tease

| DO | DON'T |
|----|-------|
| Name the framework | Explain the steps |
| Show what it surfaces/reveals | Walk through the process |
| Create curiosity about HOW | Satisfy curiosity with content |
| Leave tension unresolved | Provide relief or answers |
| "There's a method for this" | "Here's how to do it" |

### Teasing Language by Framework

**Breakthrough Mapping:**
> "Surfaces what success has been hiding"
> "Maps the behaviors that persist regardless of performance"

**MOSAEIC Method:**
> "Not suppressing the noise. Not distracting from it. Rewriting it at the belief level."

**Conviction Gauntlet:**
> "Stress-tests beliefs under fire"
> "What you believe about yourself when it counts"

**Vision Accelerator:**
> "Expands what you believe is possible"
> "The version of you that isn't managing anymore"

**Habit Harmonizer:**
> "You don't fight old habits. You make them irrelevant."

**Execution Engine:**
> "Breaks the perfectionism loop that stops action"

## VOM LANGUAGE (Voice of Market)

### Use Her Exact Words

**Identity:**
- "I'm a husk"
- "Two people" (public avatar vs. private ghost)
- "Fake work persona"
- "I've actually fooled them all"

**Emotional:**
- "Empty inside," "hollow," "numb"
- "Can't switch off"
- "Replay conversations"
- "Internal torture"

**Achievement:**
- "Golden handcuffs"
- "Is this it?" syndrome
- "Got the millions and a lousy tshirt"

**Relational:**
- "Ghost in my own home"
- "No friends, no life, nothing"

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

```markdown
# Email 5: The mechanism nobody talks about

**Status:** Final
**Framework:** Conviction Gauntlet
**CTA Destination:** VSL

---

**Subject:** The mechanism nobody talks about

Most people think the problem is stress.

Or burnout.
Or too many demands.

That's what the surface looks like.

But underneath there's something else running.

A loop.

You notice a mistake. Or a moment where you could have done better. And instead of filing it away, your brain runs it again.

And again.

Not to solve it. Just to replay it.

This isn't a bug.

It's a mechanism. One that got installed early and has been running ever since.

The reason most solutions don't work is because they try to override the loop with willpower. But the loop is smarter than willpower.

There's a different approach.

[Watch how it works]

Tomorrow I'll tell you about the guard who forgot why he was guarding.

Talk soon,
Dr. Mani

P.S. The loop isn't your enemy. It's just running the wrong code.
```
