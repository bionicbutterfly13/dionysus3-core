# IAS Email Creation Skill

This skill provides a systematic approach to crafting emails for the Inner Architect System nurture sequence targeting Analytical Empaths (Problem Aware stage).

---

## PART 1: Template Selection Rubric

### Step 1: Identify Email Purpose

Before selecting a template, classify what this email needs to accomplish:

| Purpose | Description | Best Template Types |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Connect** | Build rapport, make reader feel SEEN | Consistency Chain, Archetypal Journey |
| **Reveal** | Expose mechanism behind problem (UMP) | Curiosity Cultivator, Authority Hijack |
| **Reframe** | Shift perspective on their situation | Contrast Crafting, Fulfilled Fantasy |
| **Prove** | Demonstrate solution works (case study) | Consistency Chain + testimonial, Envy Engine |
| **Activate** | Drive toward VSL/next step | Anchoring Advantage, Scarcity Sells |

### Step 2: Check Sequence Position

| Position | Focus | Avoid |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Early (1-5) | Connection, problem naming | Heavy mechanism, direct pitch |
| Middle (6-12) | Mechanism reveal, framework tease | Full teaching, closing pressure |
| Late (13-20) | Transformation proof, urgency | New concepts, relief |

### Step 3: Match to Avatar State

**Claudia (Problem Aware) needs:**
- ✅ To feel SEEN before being taught
- ✅ Forward path, not excavation
- ✅ Logic blended with internal clarity
- ✅ Proof it works for "people like her"
- ❌ Generic high-performer language
- ❌ More introspection/emotional digging
- ❌ Price-focused value propositions
- ❌ Hype or excitement

### Step 4: Template Scoring Matrix

Score each candidate template 1-5 on:

1. **Connection Factor**: Does it open with shared experience?
2. **Mechanism Fit**: Does it allow UMP/UMS integration?
3. **Voice Match**: Can it be written calm, diagnostic, not excited?
4. **Curiosity Preservation**: Does it leave something unresolved?
5. **Avatar Specificity**: Can it speak to HER experience, not categories?

**Minimum score to use: 18/25**

### Step 5: Template Exclusions

**NEVER use for this audience:**
- Templates requiring hype language
- Templates built around price sensitivity
- Templates that require "bro energy"
- Templates that fully resolve tension

## PART 2: Topic Selection Rubric

### Step 1: Map the Awareness Arc

Track what the reader should believe at each stage:

| Email | Belief Shift |
|-------|--------------|
| 1-3 | "My problem has a name. It's not burnout." |
| 4-6 | "There's a mechanism. Past solutions failed for a reason." |
| 7-10 | "There's an architecture approach that addresses the root." |
| 11-14 | "This works for people like me." |
| 15-18 | "The cost of waiting compounds. Integration is possible." |
| 19-20 | "The only question is whether I'm ready." |

**Current email should advance ONE belief, not multiple.**

### Step 2: Psychographic Pain/Desire Check

Pull from Claudia's profile. Ask:

- Which pain point hasn't been directly addressed?
- Which desire is most activated at this stage?
- What is she SAYING to herself right now?
- What is she DOING that reveals her state?

**Topic must connect to at least ONE specific pain and ONE specific desire.**

### Step 3: Mechanism Sequencing

Check what's been introduced:

| Mechanism | When to Introduce |
|-----------|-------------------|
| The Split Self | Emails 1-3 |
| The Replay Loop / SSAR | Emails 3-5 |
| Why Past Solutions Failed | Emails 5-7 |
| Memory Reconsolidation (3 conditions) | Emails 8-10 |
| Architecture vs. Symptoms | Emails 10-12 |
| The 3 Layers (Inner OS, Identity Integration, Ecosystem) | Emails 12-15 |
| Transformation Proof | Emails 13-17 |
| Cost of Delay | Emails 15-18 |
| Direct Close | Emails 19-20 |

**Topic should reinforce current mechanism OR introduce next one. Never skip ahead.**

### Step 4: Framework Teasing Schedule

| Framework | Email to Tease | How to Tease |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Breakthrough Mapping | 11-12 | Name it. Show what it surfaces. Don't teach steps. |
| MOSAEIC Mind Gym | 11-13 | Name it. Show the rewriting (not suppressing). Don't teach. |
| Conviction Gauntlet | 14-15 | Name it. Stress-testing beliefs. Don't give process. |
| Vision Accelerator | 16-17 | Name it. Show expanded possibility. Don't resolve. |
| Habit Harmonizer | 18 | Name it. No fighting old habits. Tease only. |
| Execution Engine | 19 | Name it. Perfectionism loop breaking. Don't satisfy. |

### Step 5: Emotional Calibration

Ask before writing:

1. **Am I creating tension or releasing it?**
   - Tension = good (drives to click)
   - Release = bad (relief is the enemy)

2. **Am I orienting or encouraging?**
   - Orienting = good (diagnostic, calm)
   - Encouraging = bad (sounds like helping)

3. **Will she feel SEEN or CATEGORIZED?**
   - Seen = specific to her experience
   - Categorized = "high performers," generic

4. **Does this leave something unresolved?**
   - Yes = good (curiosity gap maintained)
   - No = rewrite (you went too far)

## USAGE CHECKLIST

Before writing any email:

- [ ] Identified email purpose (Connect/Reveal/Reframe/Prove/Activate)
- [ ] Checked sequence position
- [ ] Selected template using scoring matrix (18+ required)
- [ ] Mapped topic to awareness arc
- [ ] Connected to specific pain + desire from avatar
- [ ] Verified mechanism sequencing
- [ ] Identified framework to tease (not teach)
- [ ] Confirmed emotional calibration (tension, not relief)

After writing:

- [ ] Does this sell the click?
- [ ] Did I leave something unresolved on purpose?
- [ ] Does this sound like it was written after the answer was already known?
- [ ] Did I avoid helping, soothing, or teaching too much?
- [ ] Would Claudia feel SEEN, not categorized?
- [ ] Is every sentence earning its place? (If it doesn't move toward click, cut it)

## VOICE REMINDERS

**Write like:**
- Someone who already knows the outcome
- A diagnostician, not a cheerleader
- Calm, precise, certain

**Never sound:**
- Excited
- Nurturing
- Impressed by the reader
- Like you're "helping"

**Banned words:**
- High performers / high achievers (use HER experience instead)
- Journey, healing, vulnerable, self-care
- Breakthrough (unless clinical)
- Manifest, attract, motivation

**Required close:**
```
Talk soon,
Dr. Mani
```

## TEMPLATE QUICK REFERENCE (7+)

| # | Template | Best For |
|---|----------|----------|
| 7 | Archetypal Journey | Transformation narrative, hero's call |
| 8 | Fulfilled Fantasy | Future pacing, showing the after |
| 9 | Curiosity Cultivator | Mechanism reveal, building intrigue |
| 10 | Loss Reframe | Reframing wins as hidden costs |
| 14 | Anchoring Advantage | Value comparison (late sequence) |
| 16 | Consistency Chain | Shared experience → solution |
| 20 | Contrast Crafting | Before/after, appearance vs. reality |
| 21 | Envy Engine | Case study with aspirational pull |

## NOTES

- Ninja Nurture templates are SUGGESTIONS, not gospel
- Stefan Georgi templates are tools, adapt to our voice
- The psychographic data (Claudia) overrides template defaults
- When in doubt, ask: "Would she feel seen?"
