                    <p>You process everything at high-fidelity. Every conversation, every decision, every interaction gets analyzed from multiple angles. It's a gift that's become a burden.</p>

                    <p>You're running sophisticated mental software on an operating system that was configured for survival, not success. Every upgrade you install (new strategy, new habit, new mindset) crashes against the same core architecture.</p>

                        <li><strong>Emotional residue that won't clear</strong> — interactions replay on loop for days</li>
                        <li><strong>Chronic strategic exhaustion</strong> — you're always three moves ahead, but never present</li>
                        <li><strong>The imposter paradox</strong> — objectively successful, subjectively fraudulent</li>
                        <li><strong>Relationship friction</strong> — they don't understand why you can't "just let it go"</li>

                    <p>We map your current operating system—the loops, the triggers, the hidden load-bearing beliefs that everything else rests on. You'll see, perhaps for the first time, exactly why certain patterns keep recurring despite your best efforts to change them.</p>

                    <p>Using targeted interventions based on memory reconsolidation and active inference principles, we systematically update the faulty code. This isn't affirmations or visualization—it's structural modification at the level where patterns actually form.</p>

                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>The Inner Architect methodology is built on three core principles:</p>

                    <div class="principle">
                        <h3>1. Architecture Over Motivation</h3>
                        <p>Motivation is weather. Architecture is climate. We don't give you reasons to change—we change the structures that make old patterns inevitable.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle">
                        <h3>2. Memory Reconsolidation</h3>
                        <p>When memories are accessed in specific states, they become temporarily malleable. This window allows for structural updates that don't require willpower to maintain—they're baked into how you process.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="principle">
                        <h3>3. Active Inference Integration</h3>
                        <p>Your brain constantly predicts and updates based on evidence. We work with this system, not against it, to update predictive models at the source rather than fighting predictions after they form.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session 1 is diagnostic.</strong> If by the end of our initial session you don't have a clear map of your architecture and a specific path forward, you pay nothing.</li>

                    <li><strong>This work is permanent.</strong> You're not buying ongoing support—you're investing in a one-time rebuild that doesn't require maintenance purchases.</li>

            <div class="faq-list">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How is this different from therapy?</h3>
                    <p>Therapy typically addresses symptoms and provides coping strategies. This addresses the architecture that produces symptoms. We're not managing loops—we're restructuring the system that creates them. Many clients continue therapy alongside this work; they're complementary, not competing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Is this "woo" or is there science behind it?</h3>
                    <p>Memory reconsolidation is established neuroscience (Nader, 2000; Lane et al., 2015). Active inference is a leading framework in computational neuroscience. The application is novel; the mechanisms are documented. I'm happy to share research if that's important to your decision-making.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What if I'm "too analytical" for this to work?</h3>
                    <p>Your analytical capacity is the asset, not the obstacle. This methodology was designed specifically for minds that can't accept surface-level interventions. Your ability to see complexity is what makes structural change possible—and lasting.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's the time commitment?</h3>
                    <p>One 60-minute session per week, plus 15-30 minutes daily for integration protocols. This isn't a course with 47 hours of video. The work is concentrated and practical.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Why $3,975?</h3>
                    <p>This includes 12+ hours of direct 1:1 work, custom protocol design, between-session support, and a toolkit for ongoing self-maintenance. Compare that to therapy at $200-400/session, or executive coaching at $500-1000/hour. The ROI math is straightforward—especially when you factor in the capacity you'll reclaim.</p>

                    <h3>What happens after 12 weeks?</h3>
                    <p>You leave with a functioning system and the tools to maintain it. Some clients return for periodic tune-ups; most don't need to. The goal is independence, not ongoing dependency.</p>
