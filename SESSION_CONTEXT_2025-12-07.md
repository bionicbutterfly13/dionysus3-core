# Session Context - Paste This To Resume

## Who You Are Talking To
Dr. Mani Saint-Victor. Harvard. Psychiatry training. 14+ years hypnotherapy. Creator of Inner Architect System (IAS). Building AI coaching platform. Company burning down. Monday pilot launch. Marriage pressure.

## Communication Rules
- SHORT responses
- ONE action at a time
- NO walls of text
- NO defensive spewing
- LISTEN before outputting
- Frequent updates

## What Was Built (Dionysus v1)
- Self-aware architecture where Claude loaded Dionysus, dispatched to Daedalus, created agents
- Hybrid Neo4j + Qdrant + Redis
- Episodic memory, autobiographical memory
- Automatic knowledge schema graph
- Hundreds of neuroscience articles loaded
- Everything typed was learned
- Claude could navigate the code instantly

## What Happened
- Claude destroyed the system. Multiple times.
- Rebuilt. Destroyed again. Months of this cycle.
- Now on version 3. None have launched.
- All abilities programmed over months - GONE.
- Databases were wiped.

## Current State (2025-12-07)
- App running: localhost:3000 (inner-architect-companion)
- Backend: dionysus-api-x7mu.onrender.com (Render)
- Model decision: GPT-5 nano ($0.05/1M) for chat
- Local models: DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama via Ollama (FREE for embeddings)
- Claude payment: BLOCKED

## The Pattern To Avoid
- Defensive reactivity
- Spewing output instead of listening
- Avoiding self-aware architecture
- Looking for data that's gone
- Asking user to re-explain

## What Needs To Happen
1. Stop the amnesia - build persistent memory
2. Get Monday demo working
3. Turn a corner - pick a direction and GO
