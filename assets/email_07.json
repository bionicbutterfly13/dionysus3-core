  "email_text": "Hello,\n\nIn boardrooms and metrics-driven work, the questions we ask are precise. Traditional therapy often focuses on feelings in isolation, which misses the system that ties beliefs, actions, and outcomes together for analytical professionals. Active Inference Coaching maps beliefs to decisions and outcomes, delivering practice-ready alignment that increases speed and impact.\n\nWhat you\u2019ll gain:\n- Clarity: translate complex emotions into decision-ready signals.\n- Accountability: test beliefs with small, safe experiments.\n- Alignment: connect personal goals to team metrics.\n- Momentum: move from insight to measurable results in the boardroom.\n\nIf you\u2019re curious, I can share a brief, practical exercise you can run this week to uncover where a belief is driving actions that don\u2019t align with outcomes. No fluff, just a direct path to better decisions.\n\nWould you like to schedule a 20-minute call to discuss your current decision gaps and how Active Inference Coaching can help?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
