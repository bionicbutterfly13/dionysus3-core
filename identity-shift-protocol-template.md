# PART 1: THE ANALYTICAL EMPATH ARCHETYPE

## 1.1 Core Definition⁹

**Who They Are:**
High-achieving professionals who have optimized their lives for crisis and security. They measure themselves in metrics, always coming up short. Amazing in emergencies, terrified in peace. They override instincts in favor of logic and data. They built lives where rest equals failure. They push down emotions, building walls between themselves and their own life. Hypervigilant room-readers. They credit their intelligence and skills but not their sensitivity.

## 1.2 The Paradox⁹

> "She built the Performance Shell to survive. Underneath it beats a bleeding heart."

**Shell (Public Avatar):**
- SVP, $420K+, corner office
- Ruthless negotiator, decision-maker
- The one who holds it together
- Unflappable leader
- "Has it all figured out"

**Core (Private Self):**
- Replays conversations wondering if she hurt someone
- Feels the whole room before analyzing it
- Absorbs others' emotions involuntarily
- Processes at 10x resolution of average executive
- Questions everything in private

## 1.3 The Split Self Architecture⁷ ⁹

Two operating systems draining energy:

1. **Performative Avatar** - Built to survive, consumes energy, successful but hollow
2. **Suppressed Empath** - Authentic but hidden, the bleeding heart in the Performance Shell

**The Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem:**
They aren't broken—they're running outdated software. Their internal architecture was designed for survival, not for the life they've built. The same sensitivity that makes them extraordinary also makes them exhausted.

## 1.4 The 5 Core Desires⁸ ⁹

1. **Authenticity** - To express her full self without apology. To stop performing and start being.

2. **Connection** - To feel genuinely close to others without the armor. Real intimacy, not strategic relationship management.

3. **Purpose** - To feel her work and life mean something beyond metrics and achievements. Contribution that resonates.

4. **Confidence** - To trust herself in high-stakes moments. To stop second-guessing every decision.

5. **Peace** - To experience mental quiet and emotional calm. The replay loops finally silent.

## 1.5 The Core Obsession⁹

> "How do I make my mind stop doing this to me?"

Constant, intrusive rumination. The exhausting mental torture of thoughts they can't control. The 3 AM replay loops. The inability to let things go.

## 1.6 Qualification Criteria⁹ ⁶

**Must Have ALL:**

**Financial:**
- $20K+/year discretionary budget for self-improvement
- Established pattern of investing in programs
- Price insensitive—results matter, not cost

**Behavioral:**
- Tried multiple programs that haven't worked
- Feverish intent, not casual browsing
- Conviction: "my program is out there somewhere"

**Mindset:**
- Investment mindset: "This will be worth it when it works"
- Persistence despite failure
- Ready to commit, not just curious

## 1.7 Demographics⁹ ⁶

- **Net Worth:** $1M-$5M+ liquid assets
- **Income:** $250K-$1M+ annually
- **Age:** 35-55 (Modern Elder / Midlife Transition)
- **Occupations:** C-Suite, founders, physicians, senior partners, attorneys, consultants

## 1.8 Psychographic Profile⁶

**What They Want:**
- A structural-level approach to transformation
- The same clarity they use to engineer companies, applied to their mind
- Architecture, not therapy
- Fine-tuning, not fixing

**What They Refuse:**
- Spiritual theatrics
- Trauma spelunking
- Identity deconstruction
- Emotional overwhelm
- "Shadow work" as a lifestyle

**What They Believe:**
- They believe transformation is possible when grounded in structure
- They identify as builders and systems thinkers
- They believe inner mastery is the next frontier of leadership

# PART 2: AWARENESS-LEVEL AVATARS

*These five avatars represent prospects at different stages of the marketing funnel. Use for ad targeting, email sequences, and sales page sections.*

## 2.1 Unaware Avatar: Daniel Hartwell²

**Stage:** Doesn't know he has a problem
**Job:** Chief Operating Officer of a large engineering consultancy
**Annual Salary:** $510,000

**Profile:**
- Pragmatic, strategic, rational, reserved
- Empathic beneath a polished exterior
- Values: Competence, stability, excellence, responsibility, innovation

**Big Secret Fear:**
He worries that he may wake up one day and realize he spent his entire life maintaining success rather than actually living it. Deep inside he fears he has lost touch with the part of him that once felt inspired, curious, creative, and self-directed.

**Big Complaint (Existing Solutions):**
At this stage, he is not actively seeking personal transformation solutions. He dismisses self-development approaches as either too abstract or too emotional and assumes they are not built for someone like him.

**Top 5 Pain Points:**
1. Creeping sense of disconnection but can't pinpoint why
2. Low-level irritability and internal fatigue that no accomplishment solves
3. Relies more heavily on logic because deeper intuition feels muted
4. Respected but not deeply fulfilled
5. Strain in relationships attributed to busyness, not internal misalignment

**What He Says:**
"I'm fine. Work is intense but worthwhile. I just need to get through the next quarter."

**Use Case:** Top of funnel content—short videos, clarity quizzes, thought-provoking social posts that interrupt autopilot thinking.

## 2.2 Problem Aware Avatar: Claudia Mercer²

**Stage:** Knows something is wrong but doesn't know the cause or solution
**Job:** Senior Vice President of Strategy at a national healthcare organization
**Annual Salary:** $420,000

**Profile:**
- Highly analytical, empathic but guarded, ambitious, disciplined, deep thinker
- Values: Integrity, mastery, purpose, emotional intelligence, contribution

**Big Secret Fear:**
She fears that she built an entire life that looks impressive but feels hollow. She worries that the version of her that everyone admires is not the real her.

**Big Complaint (Existing Solutions):**
She has tried therapy, weekend retreats, meditation apps, and personality typing systems. They all point her back toward more introspection, more analysis, more emotional excavation. She is tired of digging. She wants a path forward, not another invitation to relive the past.

**Top 5 Pain Points:**
1. Carrying the weight of everyone's expectations and can't figure out how to lay it down
2. High achievement has become a cage—knows how to win but not how to feel at home
3. Exhausted from overthinking every decision, interaction, and potential outcome
4. Senses she's meant for deeper authenticity but doesn't know how to access it
5. Constant inner tug of war between outer persona and inner calling

**What She Says:**
"I'm fine. I'm busy but managing. I'll figure things out soon."

**Use Case:** Email nurture sequences, educational content, long-form posts, ads highlighting the emotional cost of staying stuck.

**Stage:** Knows solutions exist but feels overwhelmed or unconvinced
**Job:** Founder and CEO of a boutique creative agency
**Annual Salary:** $365,000

**Profile:**
- Intuitive, creative, independent, reflective, driven
- Values: Authenticity, freedom, purpose, expression, mastery

**Big Secret Fear:**
She fears she is outgrowing the life she built. She worries that her next level of self-expression will destabilize what she has already achieved. She is terrified of losing credibility if she evolves beyond the identity that made her successful.

**Big Complaint (Existing Solutions):**
She has tried spiritual retreats, breathwork, coaching, journaling, and inner child frameworks. They either lean too emotional, too mystical, or too unstructured. She knows she needs something that helps her shift from the inside out but without requiring new belief systems or years unpacking her past.

**Top 5 Pain Points:**
1. Knows she needs internal change but overwhelmed by the sheer number of available tools
2. Tired of inconsistent breakthroughs that fade when she returns to daily life
3. Wants transformation that is practical, grounded, and repeatable
4. Feels she has reached a ceiling in personal clarity and self-expression
5. Feels split between high-functioning self and the deeper, softer part

**What She Says:**
"I'm exploring ways to grow personally. I want something that works practically. I'm tired of spiritual theatrics."

**Annual Salary:** $470,000

**Profile:**
- Driven, thoughtful, perceptive, quietly sensitive, achievement-oriented
- Values: Personal mastery, integrity, conscious leadership, self-expression, growth

**Big Secret Fear:**
He fears that if he does not address the internal tension he lives with, it will eventually cost him everything. He is scared that his internal misalignment will eventually show—that he will be exposed as someone who has not fully integrated his inner world with his outer results.

**Big Complaint (Existing Solutions):**
He is frustrated by programs that promise transformation but rely on emotional catharsis, spiritual symbolism, or narrative-based introspection. He finds these approaches superficial or too abstract. He wants a true internal blueprint rather than a collection of inspirational concepts.

**Top 5 Pain Points:**
1. Knows traditional coaching can only take him so far—it focuses on behavior more than structure
2. Feels internal friction that keeps him from embodying the next level of his identity
3. Tired of inconsistent transformation results in programs that rely on emotional breakthroughs
4. Wants clarity but feels overwhelmed by approaches that require endless introspection
5. Feels torn between maintaining professional identity and exploring deeper aspects of self

**What He Says:**
"I'm looking for a method that respects intelligence and efficiency. I want something deeper than motivational content."

**Use Case:** Sales page copy, FAQ sections, decision support emails, private DM conversations, application pages.

**Annual Salary:** $580,000

**Profile:**
- Insightful, emotionally intelligent, driven, highly self-aware, independent thinker
- Values: Personal truth, authority over self, integrity, vision, freedom

**Big Secret Fear:**
Her biggest fear is that she will continue to live below her true internal potential, even though she knows it is within reach. She fears being trapped between who she used to be and who she is becoming.

**Big Complaint (Existing Solutions):**
She has experienced progress but feels that most programs treat transformation like a collection of techniques rather than an integrated system. She is tired of patchwork approaches that do not address the root architecture of her identity.

**Top 5 Pain Points:**
1. Knows change is possible but feels she has reached the limits of fragmented methods
2. Aware of her patterns but cannot fully rewire them on her own
3. Outgrowing her old identity but has not yet anchored into her new one
4. Frustrated that traditional coaching models do not match the depth she is seeking
5. Recognizes her internal blocks clearly yet lacks the internal structure to reorganize them

**What She Says:**
"I'm ready to fully step into my next level. I'm seeking a system, not scattered tools."

**Use Case:** Direct call to action content, launch emails, scarcity/urgency reminders, personal outreach, testimonials.

# PART 4: CLIENT STORIES

*These transformation stories serve as social proof. They map the Before Identity to After Identity journey.*

**→ Full narrative versions in: `NARRATIVES-LIBRARY.md` (Crack-Point Narratives section)**

---

## 4.1 Marcus: The Quiet Exit Founder⁹

**Before Identity:**
- Name: The Performative Builder / The Achievement Addict / The Hollow Founder
- External: $40M in bank, advisory work, social proof
- Internal: Can't get out of bed, profound loneliness, hollow achievements
- False Belief: "I am what I build. Without building, I'm nothing."

**The Crack:**
At his daughter's piano recital—she hit a wrong note, froze, then recovered beautifully. He realized he couldn't remember the last time he'd let himself hit a wrong note. The kid who built things for joy had been abandoned somewhere between Series A and the acquisition.

**After Identity:**
- Name: The Integrated Architect / The Whole Leader / The Grounded Founder
- Results: Wakes up feeling purpose, makes decisions from clarity

- Internal: Paralyzed by perfectionism, fear of losing control
- False Belief: "If I'm not perfect, everything falls apart."

**The Crack:**
During a routine budget review, a director presented numbers that didn't add up. Nina opened her mouth to correct it, and nothing came out.

She sat in her car in the garage for an hour afterward, confronting the thought: *What if I stop holding everything together, and nothing falls apart?*

**After Identity:**
- Name: The Collaborative Conductor / The Connected Maestro

- External: Pillar of the community, always available
- Internal: Depleted, disconnected from own needs
- False Belief: "My patients need me more than I need myself."

**The Crack:**
On a Tuesday morning before the clinic opened, reviewing labs, a wave of absence hit her. She looked at twenty-two years of giving everything and asked a question she'd never allowed: *What do I actually want?* The silence was terrifying—she had no idea. Somewhere in two decades of being Dr. Danielle, the woman named Danielle had disappeared.

**After Identity:**
- Name: The Sustained Healer / The Boundaried Physician
- Results: Serves powerfully from a full cup
- New Belief: "Taking care of myself makes me a better healer. The well has to be filled to give water. Service from depletion isn't noble—it's unsustainable."

---

### Lesson 2: Mosaeic Method — Mental Agility¹

**Transformation:** From freezing under pressure and reactive responses → To real-time awareness and skillful intervention in high-stakes moments.

**The MOSAEIC Framework:**
- **M**ind (Cognitions) - What thoughts are arising?

- **S**omatic (Actions) - What is my body doing?
- **A**ffect (Emotions) - What am I feeling emotionally?

  3. Remind yourself to stay neutral during observations

**The Narrative Tracker Tool:**
Use this journaling prompt:
- What moment felt "off" today?
- If there were a story causing me to hold back, what would it say?

Review entries weekly. Look for recurring phrases, assumptions, or "truths" that keep showing up.

---

### Lesson 3: Replay Loop Breaker — Emotional Clarity¹

**Transformation:** From drowning in mental replays and self-criticism → To skillfully breaking the loop and reclaiming calm, compassion, and mental space.

**Three Steps:**
1. Spot the story behind your most frustrating pattern
2. Label the feeling the story causes you to experience
3. Find a lesson or comfort in the imagined feeling

**Step 1: Spot the Story**

*Obstacle A: The Loop Feels Like "Truth," Not a Story*
- Solution: Name the Story, Not the Truth
  1. Complete: "The story I'm telling myself about this is ______."
  2. Treat this as an interpretation, not a diagnosis
  3. Remind yourself: "This is a story my brain is using to protect me"

*Obstacle B: Everything Feels Frustrating*
- Solution: Choose One High-Impact Pattern
  1. List the top 3 situations that replay most often
  2. Circle the one that creates the most emotional drain
  3. Commit to working with this one pattern for now

*Obstacle C: Fear of What You'll Find*
- Solution: The Story Snapshot Exercise
  1. Choose one replay scenario
  2. Write a one-sentence story: "The story I'm telling myself is: ______"
  3. Circle keywords that show up across situations
  4. Name the pattern: "This is my '______' story"

**Step 2: Label the Feeling**

*Obstacle A: Feelings Blur Together*
- Solution: Use a Simple Emotion Vocabulary
  1. Start with core emotions: sad, angry, scared, ashamed, guilty, lonely
  2. Pick just one or two words for how this feels
  3. Write them down next to your story

*Obstacle B: Fear That Feeling Will Make It Worse*
- Solution: Create a Contained Space
  1. Set a timer for 3-5 minutes to notice the emotion
  2. Use: "When I think about this, I feel ______ because I'm afraid ______"
  3. After the timer ends, do a grounding action

*Obstacle C: Confusing Emotion with Identity*
- Solution: Separate Who You Are from What You Feel
  1. Write: "I am feeling ______, which is not the same as being ______"
  2. Example: "I am feeling ashamed, which is not the same as being a failure"
  3. Repeat out loud to retrain your nervous system

**Step 3: Find a Lesson or Comfort**

*Obstacle A: Only Seeing Harsh Self-Criticism as "Learning"*
- Solution: Ask for a Small, Useful Lesson
  1. Ask: "If there were one small thing I could adjust next time?"
  2. Write a single, behavior-focused lesson
  3. Keep the lesson realistic and actionable

*Obstacle B: Struggling to Offer Yourself Comfort*
- Solution: Practice Balanced Self-Talk
  1. Complete: "Even if this wasn't perfect, it doesn't erase ______ about me"
  2. Borrow the voice you'd use with a trusted friend
  3. Write one sentence acknowledging pain, one affirming worth

*Obstacle C: All-or-Nothing Thinking*
- Solution: Create a Next-Step Plan Instead of a Verdict
  1. Ask: "What is one small next step that honors both the lesson and my well-being?"
  2. Examples: repair message, journaling, setting the loop down for the night
  3. Record the step so the replay ends with action, not rumination

**Case Study: Maya's Replay Loop**
- Story: "If I'm honest, I'll lose people."
- Emotion Sentence: "I feel scared because I'm afraid they think I'm too much."
- Lesson: "Next time, I'll be honest about how I feel and also ask how they're experiencing the conversation."
- Comfort: "Even if this was messy, it doesn't mean I'm unlovable."
- Next Step: Sent a short message checking in. The friendship didn't implode.

## 5.2 PHASE 2: REPATTERNING (Reconsolidation Design)¹

### Lesson 4: Conviction Gauntlet — Hope

*Obstacle B: Identifying False Assumptions*
- Solution: Evidence Chart
  1. Create two columns: "Evidence For" and "Evidence Against"
  2. List real examples, not feelings
  3. Write a balanced truth statement

*Obstacle C: Overcoming Confirmation Bias*
- Solution: Seek Diverse Perspectives
  1. Engage with views that challenge your own
  2. Ask for honest feedback from others
  3. Practice critical evaluation consistently

**Case Study: Jerome's Evidence Chart**
- Evidence For: One manager criticized him harshly years ago
- Evidence Against: Multiple promotions, team members seeking mentorship, successful campaigns
- New Belief: "My value grows when I learn through experience—not when I'm flawless."

**Step 3: Develop and Test Empowering Beliefs**

*Obstacle A: Creating Credible Alternatives*
- Solution: Bridging Beliefs + Micro-Experiments
  1. Start with a "bridge" belief: something neutral but forward-moving
  2. Test it in low-risk scenarios
  3. Reflect after each test: What felt different? What felt real?

*Obstacle B: Implementing New Beliefs*
- Solution: Practice Consistently
  1. Reinforce beliefs with reminders
  2. Apply them in varied contexts
  3. Monitor and adjust as needed

*Obstacle C: Handling Setbacks*
- Solution: Maintain Resilience

## 5.3 PHASE 3: STABILIZATION (Identity-Action Synchronization)¹

### Lesson 7: Habit Harmonizer — Conviction

**Transformation:** From fearing relapse into old patterns → To building unshakeable conviction in your new empowering beliefs, confidently taking action, and realizing transformative achievements.

**Three Steps:**
1. Internalize new empowering beliefs through repetition and reflection
2. Apply new beliefs in real-world situations to build confidence
3. Create and use a daily belief sustainment checklist

**Step 1: Internalize Through Repetition**

*Obstacle A: Maintaining Consistent Practice*
- Solution: Habit Stacking
  1. Choose a daily habit (e.g., making coffee, brushing teeth)
  2. While doing it, repeat your new belief aloud or silently
  3. Use a sticky note or reminder in that space
  4. Once a week, check in: Did you repeat the belief consistently?

**Case Study: Malik's Morning Ritual**
- New Belief: "My clarity is more valuable than my speed."
- Paired with: Morning coffee
- Result: Reported feeling calmer and more focused within two weeks.

**Step 2: Apply in Real-World Situations**

*Obstacle A: Translating Beliefs into Action*
- Solution: Gradual Exposure
  1. Low-Stakes Test: Use the belief in a casual interaction
  2. Mid-Level Test: Try it in a work setting
  3. High-Stakes Test: Use the belief in a critical moment

**Case Study: Malik's Confidence Curve**
- Low: Practiced slowing down in casual emails
- Mid: Used new pace in client recommendations
- High: Led a negotiation—focused, calm, powerful

**Step 3: Daily Belief Sustainment Checklist**

2. Predict potential obstacles in the plan and prepare responses
3. Seek feedback and support

**Step 1: Create Personalized Action Plan**

*Obstacle A: Developing Relevant Actions*
- Solution: SMART Goals
  1. Choose one belief to test this week
  2. Create one specific, measurable action
  3. Write it down. Post it somewhere visible.

**Case Study: Vanessa's Small-Steps Plan**
- Belief: "Small steps are powerful."
- Action: Delegate one task per week instead of doing it all herself
- Result: Within a month, team was more engaged, her stress dropped.

**Step 2: Predict and Prepare for Obstacles**

*Obstacle A: Anticipating Challenges*
- Solution: Scenario Planning
  1. For each key action, list 2-3 "what if" scenarios
  2. Write a response for each: How will you adapt or recover?
  3. Revisit your plan quarterly

**Step 3: Seek Feedback and Support**

*Obstacle A: Engaging with Support Systems*
- Solution: Structured Check-Ins
  1. Schedule one 15-minute mentor call or peer chat each month

**Three Steps:**
1. Build your personal growth system
2. Develop adaptability skills
3. Create your circle of support

**Step 1: Build Your Personal Growth System**

*Obstacle A: Designing a Sustainable Framework*
- Solution: Iterative Framework
  1. Start Simple: Begin with a 10-minute Sunday review session
  2. Add Components Over Time: After one month, layer in monthly goal review
  3. Continuous Iteration: Every quarter, adjust based on what's working

**Case Study: Nia's Living System**
- Started with: Short weekly reviews + one new skill challenge each month
- Layered in: Quarterly check-in with coach
- Result: The system adapted as she did—and that's why it stuck.

**Step 2: Develop Adaptability Skills**

*Obstacle A: Embracing Change*
- Solution: Incremental Experiments
  1. Try One New Method Monthly
  2. Reflect: After 2 weeks, note what challenged you and what helped
  3. Celebrate Adaptability: Highlight what you learned each time

# PART 6: CORE BELIEF FRAMEWORK

## 6.1 The Big Domino Statement⁷ ⁹

**Old Belief (What They Currently Believe):**
> "The fastest way to feel fulfilled is to suppress my empathy, maintain control, and achieve more."

**New Belief (What They Need to Believe):**
> "The fastest way to feel fulfilled is to integrate my empathy as a competitive advantage and rebuild my internal architecture for the life I've actually built."

**Why This Is The Big Domino:**
If they believe this ONE thing, all other objections fall away:
- Time objection? → "If this is true, I need to start now."
- Money objection? → "If this is true, it's the best investment I could make."
- Method objection? → "If this is the root issue, other methods were just treating symptoms."
- Help objection? → "If this is true, I need someone who understands this architecture."

## 6.2 The Belief Shift Mechanism¹³

**Why Counteractive Change Fails:**
Traditional approaches try to "override" old beliefs with new ones. But the brain doesn't work that way. The old belief stays intact, and the new belief becomes just another layer of cognitive noise.

**Why Memory Reconsolidation Works:**
When a belief is activated and then met with a *mismatch experience*, the brain can actually rewrite the original belief. This requires three conditions:
1. **Activation** - The old belief must be activated (felt, not just discussed)
2. **Awareness** - The person must become conscious of the belief as a belief
3. **Mismatch** - A disconfirming experience must occur while the belief is active

**The IAS Protocol applies this through:**
- REVELATION: Activates beliefs through pattern mapping
- REPATTERNING: Creates awareness through conviction testing
- STABILIZATION: Provides mismatch through real-world application

## 6.3 The Transformation Statements¹³

**Core Transformation:**
FROM: Drowning in replay loops, trapped by self-sabotage, performing a version of success that feels hollow
TO: Mental clarity, integrated identity, authentic leadership, sustainable fulfillment

**Phase-Specific Transformations:**

| Phase | FROM | TO |
|-------|------|-----|
| 1: Revelation | Confusion about recurring issues | Clear map of patterns and beliefs |
| 2: Repatterning | Fear of losing edge | Courage to challenge perspectives |
| 3: Stabilization | Fear of relapse | Unshakeable conviction in new beliefs |

# PART 7: MARKETING ASSETS

## 7.1 The Unique Mechanism⁴

**Name:** Predictive Identity Recalibration

**Big Marketing Idea:**
> "It's not self-sabotage. It's self-loyalty to an outdated identity."

**The Architecture Paradigm:**
They aren't broken. They're running outdated software. Their internal architecture was designed for survival, not for the life they've built.

**Three Key Learnings:**
1. **The Architecture Paradigm** - You're a high-fidelity processor running on wrong infrastructure
2. **Identity Before Action** - Beliefs drive behaviors; change the blueprint, not just the symptoms
3. **Ecosystem Design Matters** - Environment must support the new identity

## 7.2 The 20 Objections with Responses⁴

**Objection 1: "I've tried everything. Nothing works for me."**
Response: What you've tried addresses symptoms, not architecture. This works at the structural level.

**Objection 2: "I don't have time for another program."**
Response: This isn't about adding more to your plate. It's about removing the internal friction that makes everything harder.

**Objection 3: "How is this different from therapy?"**
Response: Therapy excavates the past. This rebuilds architecture for the future. Fine-tuning, not fixing.

**Objection 4: "I'm not sure I'm the right fit."**
Response: If you're a high-achiever who feels like you're succeeding on the outside but struggling on the inside, you're exactly the right fit.

**Objection 5: "What if it doesn't work for me?"**
Response: The system is built for analytical minds. If you've succeeded in complex environments, you can succeed here.

**Objection 6: "This sounds too 'self-help' for me."**
Response: This is architecture, not affirmations. Structure, not spirituality. Engineering, not emotion.

**Objection 7: "I should be able to figure this out myself."**
Response: You've figured out everything else. This blind spot requires a different vantage point.

**Objection 8: "What will people think?"**
Response: The people you respect most are working on themselves too. They're just quiet about it.

**Objection 9: "Is this backed by science?"**
Response: Built on memory reconsolidation, active inference, and predictive processing—the leading edge of cognitive science.

**Objection 10: "I'm not sure I want to change."**
Response: You don't have to change who you are. You get to become more of who you actually are.
