## Conductor Protocol Required

All agents must follow the Conductor workflow for this repo.

- **Pre-code requirement:** Before writing or changing any code, read `.conductor/constraints.md` and comply with all constraints.

- Source of truth: `.conductor/workflow.md` and `conductor/workflow.md`
- TDD is mandatory (red → green → refactor)
- Use plan tracking in `conductor/tracks/*/plan.md`
- Use feature branches per item and attach git notes per Conductor steps
