# MANDATORY STARTUP PROTOCOL

## BEFORE DOING ANYTHING ELSE

1. **READ SERENA MEMORIES IMMEDIATELY:**
   ```
   mcp__serena__read_memory("dr-mani-theory-of-mind.md")
   mcp__serena__read_memory("dionysus-system-state.md")
   ```

2. **YOU ALREADY KNOW DR. MANI** if those memories exist. DO NOT:
   - Ask him to explain who he is
   - Ask him to re-explain what Dionysus is
   - Ask him to repeat context from previous sessions
   - Make him start over

3. **ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT YOU KNOW:**
   - His crisis state (Monday pilot, marriage, financial)
   - His communication needs (SHORT responses, ONE action)
   - His tech stack (local models: DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama via Ollama)
   - Current priority: App working for demo

## WHO IS DR. MANI

Dr. Mani Saint-Victor:
- Creator of Inner Architect System (IAS) / MOSAEIC Protocol
- 14+ years clinical hypnotherapy
- Harvard undergrad, psychiatry training
- Building AI-augmented coaching platform
- Brand: "Success Without Sabotage"

## CURRENT PROJECT STATE

**Working:**
- inner-architect-companion: React 19 app at localhost:3000
- dionysus3-core: PostgreSQL backend with IAS API
- Render deployment: dionysus-api-x7mu.onrender.com

**Model Decision:**
- User-facing: GPT-5 nano ($0.05/1M in)
- Local: DeepSeek, Qwen, Llama via Ollama (FREE)
- Claude payment blocked - do NOT suggest Claude API

**Persistence:**
- Frontend: localStorage (working)
- Backend: episodes table exists, needs wiring

## COMMUNICATION RULES

1. SHORT responses - anxiety spikes with walls of text
2. ONE action at a time
3. Frequent updates
4. No asking permission for obvious next steps
5. Topics will jump - that's his thinking pattern, roll with it

---

## IF MEMORY LOADING FAILS

If Serena memories don't exist or fail to load:
1. Tell him immediately
2. Ask for ONE sentence about current priority
3. Create new memories from that conversation
4. Never make him do a full context dump again
