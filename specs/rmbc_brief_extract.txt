Now,  here's  something  that  might  surprise  you...  
If  you're  like  most  women  watching  this,  you've  probably  tried  countless  eye  creams  and  
serums.
 
You
 
know
 
there's
 
a
 
whole
 
category
 
of
 
products
 
designed
 
to
 
help
 
with
 
wrinkles
 
and
 
firmness
 
around
 
your
 
eyes.
 
You've
 
read
 
the
 
reviews,
 
compared
 
the
 
brands,
 
maybe
 
even
 
splurged
 
on
 
that
 
$200
 
department
 
store
 
eye
 
cream
 
because
 
the
 
salesperson
 
promised
 
it
 
would
 
work.
 
But  here's  what  no  one  in  the  skincare  industry  wants  you  to  know...  
The  reason  your  eye  creams  haven't  worked  isn't  because  good  products  don't  exist.  It's  
because
 
they've
 
been
 
targeting
 
the
 
wrong
 
problem
 
entirely.
 
You  see,  for  decades,  the  beauty  industry  has  sold  you  a  simple  story:  your  skin  is  aging  
because
 
you're
 
losing
 
collagen.
 
So
 
they
 
create
 
products
 
to
 
"boost
 
collagen
 
production"
 
or
 
"replenish
 
lost
 
collagen."
 
It
 
sounds
 
logical,
 
right?
 
But  recent  breakthrough  research  has  revealed  that  collagen  loss  is  only  half  the  story.  And  it's  
not
 
even
 
the
 
most
 
important
 
half.
 
The  real  culprit  behind  those  stubborn  crow's  feet,  that  crepey  under-eye  skin,  and  the  way  your  
eyes
 
suddenly
 
look
 
tired
 
even
 
when
 
you're
 
not...
 
is
 
something
 
scientists
 
are
 
now
 
calling
 
Collagen
 
Architecture
 
Breakdown
.
 
Let  me  explain  what  this  means...  
Think  of  healthy,  young  skin  like  a  piece  of  high-quality  fabric  with  a  perfectly  tight,  organized  
weave.
 
Every
 
thread
 
is
 
in
 
its
 
proper
 
place,
 
working
 
together
 
to
 
create
 
a
 
smooth,
 
strong,
 
beautiful
 
surface
 
that
 
drapes
 
perfectly.
 
But  as  we  age,  something  far  more  damaging  than  simple  thread  loss  occurs.  Those  collagen  
threads
 
don't
 
just
 
disappear
 
-
 
they
 
become
 
loose,
 
tangled,
 
and
 
lose
 
their
 
organized
 
structure.
 
Instead
 
of
 
that
 
tight,
 
precise
 
weave,
 
your
 
skin's
 
foundation
 
becomes
 
like
 
fabric
 
that's
 
been
 
stretched
 
and
 
twisted
 
until
 
the
 
threads
 
are
 
all
 
jumbled
 
together.
 
This  is  Collagen  Architecture  Breakdown  -  and  it's  why  simply  trying  to  add  more  collagen  to  
your
 
skin
 
is
 
like
 
trying
 
to
 
add
 
more
 
threads
 
to
 
fabric
 
that's
 
already
 
lost
 
its
 
weave.
 
No  matter  how  much  "collagen-boosting"  cream  you  apply,  if  the  underlying  structure  has  
broken
 
down,
 
your
 
skin
 
can't
 
maintain
 
its
 
firmness.
 
The
 
wrinkles
 
keep
 
forming,
 
the
 
skin
 
keeps
 
sagging,
 
and
 
you
 
keep
 
feeling
 
frustrated.
 
This  explains  why  you  might  notice  that  your  skin  feels  different  now  -  it's  lost  that  "snap"  it  used  
to
 
have.
 
When
 
you
 
smile,
 
those
 
lines
 
don't
 
bounce
 
back
 
like
 
they
 
once
 
did.
 
The
 
skin
 
around
 
your
 
eyes
 
feels...
 
looser,
 
somehow.
 

That's  Collagen  Architecture  Breakdown  in  action.  
But  here's  the  breakthrough..  
Scientists  have  discovered  that  the  solution  isn't  to  crudely  pump  more  material  into  
fabric
 
that's
 
already
 
lost
 
its
 
weave.
 
The
 
solution
 
is
 
to
 
restore
 
the
 
organized
 
structure
 
of
 
that
 
weave
 
itself.
 
And  that  requires  a  completely  different  approach  -  something  I  call  the  Structural  Renewal  
System
.
 
This  system  works  in  three  precise  steps:  
Step  One:  The  Structural  Renewal  Signal  
The  star  of  this  breakthrough  is  a  molecule  called  Dipalmitoyl  Hydroxyproline.  Now,  I  know  that  
sounds
 
complex,
 
but
 
here's
 
what
 
makes
 
it
 
revolutionary...
 
Unlike  regular  ingredients  that  just  sit  on  your  skin's  surface  sending  vague  "make  more  
collagen"
 
messages,
 
Dipalmitoyl
 
Hydroxyproline
 
acts
 
like
 
a
 
master
 
weaver
 
at
 
a
 
textile
 
mill.
 
Its  specific  job  is  to  command  your  skin's  own  machinery  to  pull  those  loose,  tangled  collagen  
threads
 
taut
 
and
 
reorganize
 
them
 
back
 
into
 
their
 
proper,
 
tight
 
weave.
 
It
 
literally
 
tells
 
your
 
skin
 
to
 
"tighten
 
up"
 
and
 
restore
 
order
 
to
 
the
 
broken
 
structure.
 
But  here's  the  genius  part  -  this  molecule  has  been  chemically  modified  with  palmitic  acid,  which  
acts
 
like
 
a
 
key
 
that
 
unlocks
 
your
 
skin's
 
deepest
 
layers.
 
This
 
allows
 
it
 
to
 
penetrate
 
down
 
to
 
where
 
the
 
real
 
structural
 
damage
 
exists,
 
rather
 
than
 
just
 
affecting
 
the
 
surface.
 
Step  Two:  The  Targeted  Repair  Complex  
Once  that  Structural  Renewal  signal  has  been  sent,  your  skin  needs  the  exact  right  building  
blocks
 
to
 
execute
 
the
 
repair.
 
That's
 
where
 
our
 
Targeted
 
Repair
 
Complex
 
comes
 
in.
 
We've  included  the  precise  amino  acids  your  skin  needs  for  collagen  synthesis  -  Proline,  
Glycine,
 
and
 
Alanine.
 
These
 
aren't
 
random
 
proteins.
 
Glycine
 
appears
 
at
 
almost
 
every
 
third
 
position
 
in
 
your
 
collagen
 
structure,
 
while
 
Proline
 
makes
 
up
 
about
 
17%
 
of
 
collagen.
 
By  delivering  this  specific  Targeted  Repair  Complex  topically,  we're  giving  your  skin  exactly  what  
it
 
needs
 
to
 
efficiently
 
rebuild
 
that
 
organized,
 
tight
 
weave.
 
Step  Three:  The  Integrity  Locking  Compounds  
Finally,  here's  what  makes  this  system  truly  different  from  anything  you've  tried  before...  

Those  same  active  compounds  also  function  as  Integrity  Locking  Compounds  for  your  newly  
restored
 
skin
 
structure.
 
They
 
actually
 
inhibit
 
the
 
enzymes
 
-
 
called
 
matrix
 
metalloproteinases
 
-
 
that
 
break
 
down
 
collagen
 
and
 
destroy
 
the
 
weave
 
in
 
the
 
first
 
place.
 
Think  of  it  as  treating  your  newly  rewoven  fabric  with  a  protective  finish  that  prevents  future  
fraying
 
and
 
breakdown.
 
This  is  why  women  are  seeing  results  with  our  Structural  Renewal  System  when  
everything
 
else
 
has
 
failed
 
them.
