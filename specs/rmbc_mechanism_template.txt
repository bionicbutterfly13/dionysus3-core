Unique Mechanism 
(RMBC) 
  
 Explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve 
 Problem/solution lead 
 ‘What’s missing’? Why fail in past? Why succeed in future? 
 Unique solution 
 Logically connected 
 Find one major, throbbing pain point and try to fix it 
 
I. In a Nutshell: 
  
The unique mechanism explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal… 
  
And how they can overcome that problem. 
  
At its core, the unique mechanism is always a two-part logical connection. 
   
II. There are two parts to the unique mechanism: 
  
1. Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem our Prospect Faces. 
  
2. Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution to that Problem. 
  
It’s important to identify the unique mechanism behind both the problem AND the solution. 
  
By showing the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why 
they’ve failed in the past. 
  
By showing the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our 
product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed. 
  
III. To Put It Another way… 
  
Typically by the time our prospect comes to us, they’ve tried numerous solutions to their 
problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, worked 
partially, or worked fully for a period of time (before they stopped working). 
  
Our job as a copywriter is to educate our prospect about the REAL reason why past solutions 
didn’t bring them permanent results. We do this by explaining that their knowledge about the 
problem is incomplete. They’ve been missing ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, and this 
“knowledge gap” is what’s been holding them back.
