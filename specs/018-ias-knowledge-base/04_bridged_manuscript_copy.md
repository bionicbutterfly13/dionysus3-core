Is Dr. Mani, welcome to Asylum, let's get it.

Before we dive in, let me tell you who I am and why I'm qualified to talk to you about this.

I'm a psychiatrist turned Ericksonian hypnotherapist. I spent years in traditional psychiatry—started my residency back in 2008—but I left. I left because I realized that the model wasn't working for the people I most wanted to help. The people who were smart, capable, driven, who understood their problems intellectually but couldn't seem to break the patterns.

I went and did software development, game design, built virtual worlds. I think in music, sound, and abstract complex patterns. That's how my brain works. And eventually I came back to clinical work because I found something that actually moves the needle: memory reconsolidation, Ericksonian approaches, helping people update the predictions their brain is making at the identity level.

Over the past fourteen years, I've worked with over 870 clients. Not the people who need medication adjustments or crisis intervention—though that work is important. I work with the analytical empaths. The high-performers who keep self-sabotaging despite knowing better.

If that's you, this is for you.

You're smart. You've read the books. You understand the concepts. You can explain your own patterns to other people with impressive clarity. And yet—you keep doing the same damn thing. You know you should launch. You don't launch. You know you should set the boundary. You don't set it. You know you should stop giving your energy to people who drain you. You keep giving it anyway.

What I'm about to share with you is the framework that has helped me—and hundreds of my clients—actually break these patterns. Not by understanding them better. You already understand them. But by recognizing them in real-time, when you're in them, so you can make a different choice.

We're going to talk about the Drama Triangle.

This isn't a model I invented. It comes from Stephen Karpman—or as I sometimes accidentally call him, Cartman, because the way I store data I tend to hold the model and sometimes forget who I learned it from. That's called source amnesia. I get it bad. But I want to acknowledge upfront that this is the model that has served me well in maintaining positive emotional states and not staying stuck and draining energy in things that don't lead to my desired outcome.

Here's what we're going to cover: how your brain actually works with these fractal thought loops. What dysfunctional interactions do to you neurologically and emotionally. The three positions on the Drama Triangle—Victim, Villain, and Hero—and how each one keeps you stuck in different ways. The difference between evaluative and descriptive feedback and why it matters for your execution. What happens when you internalize these patterns as an inner critic. And finally, how to find and surround yourself with people who actually help you grow.

One disclaimer before we go further: I'm a non-linear thinker. I multi-thread between ideas. If you're a linear thinker, this might feel a little chaotic. That's fine—it'll all connect by the end. But if you can't ride with non-linear thinking, you're probably not a good candidate for coaching with me anyway because it would grab you bad. There's that.

If you're a non-linear thinker, though? Buckle up. This is gonna be extra fun.

Let's get into it.

# CHAPTER 1: How Your Brain Actually Works
*Estimated Runtime: 11 minutes | ~1,600 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

Before we can talk about dysfunctional patterns, you need to understand how your brain processes reality in the first place. This is the foundation everything else builds on. Once you get this, the Drama Triangle will make a lot more sense.

---

Basically your brain works on these constant loops and the loops are fractal—as in they're embedded in each other like nested Russian dolls. You're running some sort of thought loop at all times. Some loops are shorter construal. When you're scared the loop is super narrow because it's like "oh shit what do I do now, what do I do now, what do I do now."

Imagine this: You're about to give a presentation. Your heart is racing. Your palms are sweating. In that moment, your brain isn't planning next week. It's not thinking about your five-year vision. It's running a tight, fast loop: "What do I say next? What if I forget? What if they think I'm stupid? What do I say next?"

That's a narrow loop. That's beta state—high frequency brain waves, sympathetic nervous system activation, cortisol pumping through your system.

As opposed to as you calm down, those same cycles happen but because of the sense of certainty, a sense of control, and a sense of self-efficacy, loops run over wider periods of time. Your relationship with time changes when you're not in fight-flight.

When you're calm, when you're in alpha state, you can plan Friday on Tuesday. You can commit to something three months out and trust that you'll still want to do it when the time comes. Your loop is wide enough to hold the future as real and stable.

Because you're able to say to a friend or someone with a sense of integrity, "Hey, I want to see you on Friday. I trust myself to still be in a state of mind where I want to see you on Friday despite the fact that it's Tuesday."

That statement—that simple act of making a plan with someone—requires a remarkable amount of internal stability. You're trusting that future-you will still be aligned with present-you. That's not nothing. That's actually a profound act of self-trust.

In order to take state-independent action—which means action that's independent of how you're feeling in the moment—you need willpower. You need to be able to notice how you feel in the moment because that's important. You need to notice the urges to stay home, to cancel, to do something more interesting. And then you need to be able to evaluate in that moment and still pull out your commitment—and not only your commitment but your why. Why you're honoring the commitment.

This is where a lot of analytical empaths get stuck. You feel something in the moment—anxiety, resistance, fatigue—and because you're highly attuned to your internal states, you take that feeling seriously. Sometimes too seriously. The feeling becomes a reason not to act.

In a lot of cases it becomes about the relationship with the person, the fact that you guys have a shared vision, and the person is depending on you to maintain your integrity so that they in turn can feel a sense of integrity, stability, and safety in the world. You're honoring their calendar, they're honoring your calendar, you guys are able to be synergistic. They have a sense of trust, and as such when they're thinking to Friday they're able to stay in Alpha state as well—instead of fight-flight beta waves, which are sympathetic arousal of something that may or may not happen.

See how this works? Your reliability becomes part of someone else's nervous system regulation. When you show up consistently, you help them stay calm. When you flake, you knock them into uncertainty. This is why integrity matters beyond just keeping promises—it's actually a form of relational regulation.

In some people's case it becomes self-doubt because they wonder if you're that good a friend, if you're gonna show up, if you don't show up what it means about them. All these things.

I'm setting a frame as to why these are the good things that happen, these are the healthy ways of being. This is presence. When you're present you're able to trust for the things that you have lined up, planned and predicted. Beyond that you're able to trust that your sense of self, your identity, your sense of integrity and sense of wholeness will remain in place despite things not going as planned. You're able to detach from outcomes and perform your action in the present, fully aware.

Let me go back to the thought loop because essentially the way we experience our conscious thoughts is that most of the day your unconscious mind, your habit system, your mindless self is running stuff. You're running through these routines that you have in your day. You don't need to do much thought for those.

Think about your morning routine. You don't consciously decide to brush your teeth. You just do it. That's your habit system running a loop automatically. It frees up your prefrontal cortex for the novel stuff, the decisions that actually require attention.

You have the opportunity to stay present in the moment. By staying present in the moment you're not caught up in the past, you're not beating yourself up about your old self, you're not feeling stuck, you're not feeling incapable, you're not feeling trapped and unable to change.

You're also not caught in the future. As such you're not in a worry state which feels bad where you're not able to plan and your engine is revving because you're like "oh God I'm not gonna be able to do it." So you pop back into those beta waves, that higher frequency, that fight-flight sympathetic cortisol-based frequency.

Another state of not being present is when you're future casting—when you're imagining an outcome and it looks good but you stay in it because either the present is too painful, so you don't want to face it. You sort of defend your ego by staying in the ego narration of what it's going to be like instead of what it is now.

I see this all the time with my clients. They can describe their future success in vivid detail. They've got the vision board. They've got the journal entries. But they're using that future vision as an escape from the present discomfort rather than as a compass for present action. There's a difference.

If you've watched some of my early videos you've heard me discuss that it's important to have the energy in place to be able to hold two thoughts in mind. We can't do that when our working memory—which is our experience where we store our experience of consciousness—if our working memory is taxed by what's called identity threat, then your brain contracts into that fight-flight ego defense mode. Protecting the image, protecting the illusion, protecting the persona and the mask because you get afraid of if you contact the truth, if you're connected with the truth, what will it mean.

Now with that being said, as humans we create reality in a relational way. Whether it's relating to yourself with positive self-talk, auto-suggestion, spending time in the mirror, gestures of self-love, choosing to identify with and surround yourself with tribes of people who reflect your truth as opposed to reflecting the illusion that you want to put out there. People who don't need your mask. People who love you as your authentic self.

These are all aspects of thriving.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

So here's what to take from this chapter: Your brain runs in loops. When you're calm, those loops are wide—you can hold the future, you can make commitments, you can act with integrity. When you're triggered, those loops narrow—you get reactive, present-focused in a panicked way, and you can't access your values. The question is: what knocks you from wide loops to narrow loops? That's what we're going to explore next.

# CHAPTER 2: What Dysfunctional Interactions Do To You
*Estimated Runtime: 9 minutes | ~1,300 words*

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

Now that you understand how your brain processes reality through these thought loops, let's talk about what happens when someone disrupts that process. This is where dysfunctional interactions come in—and why they're so damaging to your ability to execute.

---

Everything you read from me has gone through a significant editing and linearization process because that's not how I think. I think in music, sound, and abstract complex patterns.

I say that because when you're dealing with toxic people in dysfunctional interactions they don't honor your thinking style. They don't honor the way thoughts come to mind.

Let me give you an example. Imagine you're in a meeting. You've got an idea forming—it's not fully baked yet, but you can feel it crystallizing. You're in that creative space where the pattern is emerging. And then someone interrupts. Not just any interruption—a dismissive one. "That's not how we do things." "You're overthinking this." "Can we just move on?"

In that moment, what happens inside you? Your emerging thought collapses. Your working memory, which was holding that delicate pattern, gets hijacked by threat detection. Suddenly you're not thinking about the idea anymore. You're thinking about yourself. About how you're being perceived. About whether you're safe.

That's what toxic interactions do. They knock you offline.

The way thoughts come to mind for just about everyone in my experience is that something happens in the environment that catches my attention. It turns my attention towards it and as such my system goes into an immediate fight-flight evaluation: Is this a threat? Is it an opportunity?

There's four memes that we use to remember this in marketing real quick. When something happens in someone's environment there's an opportunity. Is this an opportunity to run because this is something that's going to eat me? Is it an opportunity to fight it because it looks delicious and I want to kill it to eat it, or I want to kill it to survive? Fight, flight, feed—I kind of conflated feed and fight but fight is opportunity to beat it, feed is an opportunity where I think I can kill it and eat it and it looks delicious. Or the fourth F: can I screw it? Reproduction.

These are the core drives. When something comes into your environment there are some more complex drives that may kick in that are mixes of those and some that have evolved and been taught, but when something surprises or startles you those are the first things you evaluate.

Once you've passed through this evaluation process an urge emerges. You're going to have this urge. Your first impulse is going to be a survival impulse.

Based on your state of equanimity, your state of perceived arousal, your evaluation, and how much the fear or the commitment to another one of your core values kicks in—based on how that happens you choose an action. You choose it to different levels of abruptness and well-thought-outedness.

You might take action in a way that's not well thought out if you perceive this to be a threat or you perceive it to be something scarce or urgent such that the window of opportunity is narrow. Even your most flubbed and worst attempt to get it will still give you either practice or the opportunity to eat, survive, procreate, or get up out of there.

So you take that rapid action. Now the thing is that with those urges—those urges happen that lets you know what your belief system is. In a lot of cases those urges can be connected to a limiting belief.

That's your natural loop: you evaluate and then you take an action based on what you believe to be the truth in that moment and what you value—if you can pull up your values in your mind.

What interferes with your ability to pull up those values in your mind is either internal negative self-talk (which is the product of prior dysfunctional interactions) or prior dysfunctional interactions that are coming back to mind in the moment, triggered by something—some environmental cue—or because you're in that moment having a dysfunctional interaction.

Think about that. The reason you can't access your values in the moment is because you're either hearing old voices in your head from past toxic interactions, or you're currently in one. Either way, the dysfunctional dynamic is taxing your working memory, leaving less space for you to connect with what you actually want and who you actually are.

The way to identify dysfunctional interactions is to learn how to recognize toxic people in dysfunctional interactions when you're in them.

The way you can identify them when you're in them is because they make you feel bad. Your internal compass is an emotional guidance system.

If you can move beyond the initial fear and startle to remember what it is that you want as the outcome, what the intention is—without the threat, without the fear, without the startle, without being knocked out of present moment truth-based intentional action decision-making and action-taking—if something knocks that process offline, that is a dysfunctional interaction.

Here's a question to ask yourself: After I leave this interaction, do I feel more or less capable? More or less clear? More or less aligned with my purpose?

If the answer is less—even if the person was being "helpful" or "caring"—you may have just experienced a dysfunctional interaction.

Because we're relational creatures like I said before, the goal is to surround yourself with loving, supporting, productive people who share your vision such that you don't spend a bunch of your time trying to explain the reality and truth that you know to be true to someone who's too busy worrying about the future and imposing it on you, or criticizing you about past mistakes that you made when you're not even there anymore.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

So to summarize: dysfunctional interactions knock you out of your natural loop. They hijack your working memory, trigger your threat detection, and prevent you from accessing your values. The result? You can't execute. Not because you're incapable, but because you're operating in a contracted state. Now let's look at the framework that helps you recognize exactly what's happening when you're in these dynamics.

# CHAPTER 3: The Drama Triangle Framework
*Estimated Runtime: 9 minutes | ~1,300 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

This is the core of what I'm going to teach you today. Everything else has been building to this. The Drama Triangle is the tool that lets you recognize dysfunctional patterns in real-time—so you can make a different choice before you get stuck.

---

The goal is to warm up to the point where I tell you how to recognize the three key types of dysfunctional interactions.

The technique that's been most effective for me to recognize when you are in dysfunctional interactions and in toxic relationships is the drama triangle.

You recognize the drama triangle by... you use the drama triangle by recognizing how you are behaving in the moment. It is most useful to pull these concepts into mind when you're feeling bad, when you're feeling ineffective, or when you're looking back as the remembering self and realizing that you wish you had done something differently or said something differently or pulled out of an interaction earlier.

In the moment you might have some short-term pleasure—whether it's telling someone two extra phrases that you really need to get out—and then realizing that maybe you're married to this person and for the rest of their lives when they look at you they will remember that you said that phrase. Maybe it's a child of yours and later on as they grow older... because the phrase hurt you, possibly because you remember someone hurting you with the phrase. Despite the fact that they got results from you, when the phrase is not in alignment with your values in that moment, when you look back you kind of beat yourself up and you get into that decreasing your self-esteem and your sense of self-efficacy.

The key thing is you use these concepts when you feel bad. Anytime you're in a negative emotional state, remember: you feel stuck, you're not stuck. When you're feeling stuck you want to evaluate: which of these roles am I being constrained into? And what aspect of my current environment—if there's someone in this moment in a dysfunctional interaction—that is making me feel less powerful, less empowered, less capable, less intelligent, less beautiful, less creative, less whatever it is that your identity is. That thing that you have been practicing since childhood. The thing that you know is you.

Before I start on the models of the drama triangle—and I think it's Karpman with a P, if not it's Cartman... the way I store data I tend to hold the model and sometimes because models have been discovered by multiple people with nuances I tend to forget, I get what's called source amnesia where I forget who I learned the model from—but I just want to make sure that I acknowledge that this is not a model that I came up with. It's the model that I came across that has served me well in maintaining positive emotional states and not staying stuck and draining energy in things that don't lead to my desired outcome.

There are three positions in the drama triangle. Picture an upside-down triangle. At the top left, you have the Hero. At the top right, you have the Villain. At the bottom point, you have the Victim.

The important thing about the drama triangle is when someone takes one of the roles on the drama triangle they usually try to force you or knock you into another one of these roles.

So when you feel one of these positions, when you're feeling a certain type of way, notice what the other person is doing or what you're imagining that they're doing that's leading to you in this state.

The second powerful aspect of the drama triangle is it allows you to do some introspection in private. When you play back prior events that you feel bad about you're able to kind of clean up your memory and power yourself so that the next time that cue, that environmental event comes up, and you get the urge and you get the emotions—because the urge often has an emotional charge with it—when those emotions come up you have a split second of recognition.

Recognition is re-cognition. You get to think a thought again, which means that you're retrieving a memory and realizing that this is something happening in your head and you have an opportunity to alter that memory by changing the action that you've connected it to, by changing how it makes you feel, by realizing that this is part of your past—the prior wound coming up in the moment—and as such is connected to a limiting belief. You're able to do this in private inside your head when you internalize these concepts of the drama triangle.

When you understand the drama triangle, when you're sitting by yourself, what you want to do is look at prior events that upset you and say "Am I doing this dance? Did I go into one of these positions?"

Another thing to understand about the drama triangle is you can go from one position to the other. You can start as a Victim, ricochet into Villain, and then swing back to Hero—all in one conversation. The positions aren't fixed. They're dynamic. That's what makes this a dance.

Let me tell you about the positions so that you can imagine: effectively there are two top positions. They feel powerful but they're not efficacious. They are bound to the identity threat so they're kind of in a fear mode and they're trying to get stuff done. And then at the bottom you have a third position which feels less powerful.

The top two positions are called the Hero position and the Villain position. The third one is called the Victim position—the bottom position—because you feel disempowered in that moment.

Remember that all three of these positions—when you look back on the actions that happened that you may not have caught in that fleeting moment—you feel bad about it. It doesn't feel good that you've acted in a certain way. It was out of alignment. It wasn't your higher self. These are your lower self ways of being.

Up top, the top two—hero and villain—they feel powerful. The bottom is the victim: it feels less powerful, less expressive, less heard, less acknowledged, less validated, less connected to meaning, less motivated in that moment.

I don't want to say intrinsically motivated because the villain and the hero, they're more triggered and they just don't realize it. They feel powerful but later on they'll feel bad and that leads to a delayed sense of disempowerment.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

So that's the framework: three positions—Victim at the bottom, Hero and Villain at the top. All three feel bad in retrospect. The key is to ask yourself when you feel stuck: which position am I in? Now let's go deep on each one, starting with the Victim.

---

# CHAPTER 4: The Victim Position
*Estimated Runtime: 11 minutes | ~1,600 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

The Victim position is where most people start when they feel stuck. It's the first position you usually land in before ricocheting into one of the others. Understanding it deeply will help you recognize when you're in it—and what to do about it.

---

I want to start with the victim. The victim is a feeling as if... ooh, you're stuck. It's the first stuck position. It's sort of a state of paralysis: I can't get stuff done, nothing I do matters, I'm practicing and I'm not seeing progress, I don't trust this process as much, I'm not feeling connected to my vision. Usually it's because you've been triggered.

Let me paint you a picture. Imagine you're an entrepreneur—smart, capable, you've built things before. You're in a meeting with potential investors or partners. You have a good idea. You know it's good. But as soon as someone asks a challenging question, something shifts inside you.

Your voice gets quieter. Your posture changes. You start qualifying everything. "Well, it's just an idea..." "I'm not sure if it would work, but..." "Maybe I'm wrong about this..."

That's the Victim position activating. You're not actually incapable. You're feeling incapable. There's a difference. But in that moment, the feeling becomes the reality.

When you're in that state you develop a resentfulness. Often in the victim position you develop either a neediness—where instead of focusing on the learning, focusing on the journey, and focusing on having a vision in mind with such clarity that the feedback you're getting from the person helping you (your mentor, your coach, your guide)... instead of hearing their feedback you could either be in a super needy state where your goal is to behave in such a way that they continue to do the stuff for you.

There's a clinginess, there's a dependency. This is a codependent dynamic in the victim position.

That's one of two ways. Or you could be behaving in a defensive way where instead of being honest, vulnerable, transparent, and authentic in that moment such that you're able to grow from your mistakes, you're defending yourself from a villain/persecutor/tyrant. I'll talk more about that in a second.

Think about how this plays out practically. You ask someone for feedback on your work. They give you honest feedback—not cruel, just honest. But instead of hearing it as information, you hear it as an attack. So you either go needy ("Please tell me how to fix it, I can't figure it out myself, just tell me what to do") or defensive ("Well, you don't understand my vision" or "You don't know the full context").

Neither response actually helps you grow. Both keep you stuck in the Victim position.

Another thing about the victim position: when you're dealing with a villain in that interaction, it attracts a hero. This is where the triangle kicks in and next you know, instead of being self-efficacious, someone else comes up and they're either like "I'm gonna do it for you" or it becomes about the drama.

Suddenly you're watching two people fight over the fact that a villain is treating you bad, talking to you in the wrong way, being too much of a tyrant on the rules. And then it pulls a hero onto the dance and the hero and the villain are arguing back and forth instead of you getting shit done.

I've seen this happen in business partnerships, in marriages, in families. Someone's stuck in Victim. Someone else jumps in as Villain to criticize. A third person jumps in as Hero to rescue. And now there's a whole drama playing out—and the original person, the one in Victim, is just sitting there watching. Still stuck. Still not executing. But now there's entertainment, so it doesn't feel as bad.

This is—remember—this is about information exchange and allocation of energy. You're wasting time. You're not on your path to your vision. Instead you're stuck in this stuff where at the end of it you walk away from that situation feeling as if you can't do for yourself, you haven't learned anything new other than how to watch two people argue and get nowhere.

From the victim position, often it's uncomfortable. There's a sadness, there's a sense of grief, a sense of disempowerment, a sense of loss. So we often want to ricochet out of that and get a sense of being powerful.

One of the ways we can do that sometimes is: as we start to learn rules we decide that we don't want the goal anymore. We start to stop growing, stop being honest about who we are and where we are on our journey. We jump to basically taking what we know and instead of growing and learning and becoming nurturing to those behind us, we jump into the villain position.

This is the ricochet. The Victim who gets tired of feeling powerless and overcorrects into Villain. "I'm not stuck—everyone else is stupid." "I'm not incapable—the market is broken." "I'm not the problem—they are."

We decide we're not going to grow anymore. We decide that the dream is unattainable and anyone pursuing it is stupid. We get more focused on looking powerful and feeling powerful. We want to stay in that state. We don't want to be vulnerable. We have this mask of power wielded by punishing anyone who challenges our perception of reality, challenges the mask that we're putting up. Instead of being authentic and reflecting on what people are telling us, or instead of respecting the personhood of a person who is stuck and needs help and is confused and is having self-doubt and doesn't believe in himself—we as a villain, we pounce on that opportunity to feel more powerful, feel like we know more. Even though we only know about losing. We know about being stuck.

And so we keep that person in the stuck state because in that dimension, in that version of reality, our truth matters.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

That's the Victim position. It feels disempowering, it creates dependency, and it often attracts the other two positions into a drama dance. And when it becomes too uncomfortable, many people ricochet into Villain—which we'll explore next.

# CHAPTER 5: The Villain Position
*Estimated Runtime: 13 minutes | ~2,000 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

Now let's look at the Villain position—the one that feels powerful but isn't. This is where a lot of energy gets drained, both yours and other people's. There are two main types of Villains, and once you recognize them, you'll start seeing them everywhere.

---

This involves discouragement. This involves as soon as someone comes up at the beginning of an idea that doesn't fit with your worldview, projecting your judgment onto it.

One of the characteristics of villains is that they suck the energy out of you. They do this with their feedback because their feedback is more criticism. It attacks who you are. It attacks the behaviors you've done in the past and knocks you into the past. And even sometimes knocking you into the future where you project a negative outcome for yourself because you have this toxic person who feels powerful, who understands the rules, but is projecting loss onto you so that they can keep you dependent on the path of loss that they're taking.

Think about someone in your life—maybe right now, maybe from your past—who has this effect on you. You come to them with excitement about something, and by the time you leave, you feel deflated. Maybe they didn't even say anything overtly negative. But something about the interaction drained you.

That's the Villain energy. It doesn't always look like aggression. Sometimes it looks like "concern." Sometimes it sounds like "just being realistic." But the effect is the same: you leave with less energy, less clarity, less belief in yourself.

Advantage of your self-doubt. They're taking advantage of the moment in which your idea and your thought is so new that you haven't fully gotten used to it as part of you. You don't fully know how it fits and connects to your purpose to the point where... basically the feeling causes a missed opportunity. An opportunity for learning, an opportunity for growth becomes an opportunity to be reminded of your weaknesses, your prior failures. They keep you in a sense of low self-efficacy.

If you remember my prior video about intrinsic motivation in video two: in order to have intrinsic motivation there's two aspects. There's a belief that you can do it (which is the feasibility)—which includes you can do it, belief that the world works in such a way that if you pursue it in a focused and determined and clear enough way you will be able to obtain the outcome—and desirability: do you even really want it?

A villain can convince you that you can't do it. And as such a lot of us, our brains, when we can't have something we go into sour grapes. We devalue that thing as a way of coping. It's a mechanism of self-regulation.

There's two key types of villains you'll run into.

**The Persecutor:** You'll run into a persecutor where you just can't do anything right. This person will point out all your mistakes before they're even really mistakes. Basically as soon as they see you acting they jump in and they already tell you what's wrong with that "mistake."

Imagine this: You're working on a project. You've barely started. You're maybe ten percent in. And someone walks by and immediately starts telling you what you're doing wrong. Not helpful feedback—preemptive criticism. "You know that's not going to work, right?" "You should have done it this other way." "That's not how we do things here."

It leads to a certain defensive perfectionism where you're afraid to act. The whole time you're in your mind you walk around imagining this person pouncing on you and you develop this people-pleasing, "what would people think," "what are people saying behind my back" type of mindset. That is a persecutory person.

The Persecutor creates a version of you that's constantly braced for criticism. You start editing yourself before you even act. You become your own Persecutor, internalizing their voice.

**The Tyrant:** The other one which is also slightly persecutory, honestly, is sort of the tyrant. It's higher. Imagine it: the tyrant is a person who is so held up on the rules and again evaluating you according to these rules and they leave your thought back into the old. They knock you into the past so you can't stay present to the opportunity in the moment because all they're projecting onto you is out in the past—these other rules of society, culture, and your past identity group, your tribe of origin have lived by.

The Tyrant doesn't attack you personally like the Persecutor does. The Tyrant attacks you through rules, norms, expectations. "That's not how it's done." "You should know better." "Our family doesn't do that." "People like us don't..."

This creates a sense of threat on "who am I" because you feel in your imagination that you're running the risk of being not only devalued but being ousted from your tribe. And in our subconscious software, being ousted from your tribe meant starvation, it meant being eaten by saber-toothed tigers, it meant a very certain type of death.

To the point where your immune system shifts so that when you're dealing with risk of being ousted—remember your subconscious mind is a prediction machine so what it believes is going to happen next is what it prepares your entire body for—this person is essentially knocking you into a pretty threatening and scary future.

**[MID-CHAPTER BRIDGE]**

Stay with me here—I'm about to connect this to something that happens in your actual body. This isn't just psychology. It's physiology.

---

As such your immune system prepares for being ousted. Your old subconscious prepares you from being ousted from your tribe, getting eaten by tigers, getting injured and whatever—all the dangers that we culturally in the collective unconscious imagine happening when we get ousted from our tribe.

As a result of that you get an immunological profile that's more bacterial, more feeling isolated, feeling... it just takes you to an immunological state that happens to involve a sense of withdrawal, a sense of shame, high cortisol.

What does this feel like in your body? Tension in your shoulders and jaw. A tight stomach. That feeling of wanting to disappear or become invisible. Your energy pulls inward. You want to hide.

Whereas—and this is fight-flight—the immunological profile that goes with fight-flight: I'm about to fight, I need my immune system ready so I don't catch an infection from this fool. I'm about to be kicked out of the tribe. I'm about to not only have to whoop someone's butt and possibly lose and drop in social status and be kicked out of the tribe because I'm less valuable. Even if I do get to stay in the tribe I'll probably be getting the less good food, less good choice of mating opportunity, and so on and so on. So your immune system kicks in in that moment.

The other immune profile—if you're not being triggered—is the tend and befriend profile where your body prepares for a viral attack. What's neat about this is when your body prepares for a viral attack it's in that tend and befriend mode instead of fight-flight because your body is imagining that you're going to be surrounded by people who you love but they don't have germs—they're gonna have viruses and stuff. People will be coughing and stuff, not everyone washes their hands and so on. So your body prepares for these viral attacks by going towards a more viral immunological profile.

One of the things that goes with that viral immunological profile is just a feeling of connectedness, a feeling of belonging. Viruses have evolved to spread in a very specific way in an environment where people are close together and so we've co-evolved so that when people are close together we're ready for viruses but we do it in a way where you want to stay engaged with folks. There's less of a shame profile in it, in my mental model.

So that's the villain. That's how the villain knocks you out of integrity, knocks you out of the present, disconnects you from truth.

This disequilibrates that core model that I keep going back to where the way your brain works is that you imagine a future state, you imagine how good it will feel, you do the math to see what it's going to take in a deep visceral way where you visualize it in full color vision-board details.

Some of the latest stuff that I've been reading points out that it's not enough to just have the vision board. When you encounter the vision board you want to turn and activate your imagination such that you're seeing yourself—it's important to see yourself in the vision, walking through the vision.

Now what happens when we're attacked is that we hop out of ourselves. We dissociate because we see the story, we try to see the story from the other person's point of view. In some cases it becomes identifying with the aggressor where you're like "What am I doing wrong? What's wrong with me? What is it that I'm presenting that's causing me to be attacked?"

And if it's not just a dysfunctional interaction in the moment but a toxic person, you develop that "Why do I keep attracting this kind of person in my life? Why am I stuck in this pattern?"

Often if you don't have the insight to realize it's a pattern you mistake it and make the inference: "Why are people this way?"

And then a lot of times the society pushes the mythology about rich people being selfish, a shortage of men, a shortage of physicians—these shortage scarcity models that they push out cause you to quickly assume that the person in front of you is the only person type that is out there. That you need to hurry, you need to allow people to continue to treat you in a way that doesn't feel good because there are not that many other people out there who will be willing to love, nurture, support you.

That's the villain. I think I pretty much covered that in enough detail where I feel cognitive closure.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

The Villain drains your energy, knocks you into the past or a scary future, and convinces you that you can't succeed. Whether through the Persecutor's preemptive criticism or the Tyrant's rule-based judgment, the effect is the same: you end up stuck. Now let's look at the third position—the Hero. And this one's tricky, because it feels like love.

---

# CHAPTER 6: The Hero Position
*Estimated Runtime: 13 minutes | ~2,000 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

This is the position that catches people off guard. Because unlike the Villain, the Hero feels good. It feels like someone finally on your side, finally helping you. But there's a hidden cost—and it's just as damaging to your execution as the Villain.

---

Outstanding. The hero. The hero is an entirely different dynamic.

Again, in this diagram a hero is not a great thing. This is someone who comes through and—a better word for it is Rescuer but Hero is easy to remember—is someone who comes through and they may initially believe that you can do it, but at some point it just gets good to them that every time they help you you're so grateful.

Keep in mind you're feeding this dynamic because what you're doing at the same time is every time they help you you're over-rewarding it. And this is someone who has a little bit of self-doubt themselves so they don't have as much of an internal locus of control and that external validation, those compliments, that flattery sets them on fire. They just keep doing more stuff.

This is the seductive trap. The Hero feels like love. It feels like support. It feels like someone finally getting you, finally helping you, finally on your side.

But here's the hidden message underneath all that help: "You can't do this without me."

Instead of doing the hands-off and seeing if you can swim on your own, they basically are super overly helpful to the point of nurturing to the point of suffocation. Because the message it sends you is that you're not capable, you need this person to continue the journey.

Here's what's less productive about it: even if this person is moving forward in their journey they're moving forward with this lower self-efficacy energy. As such even if they have mentors and coaches and a support system, they have that suffocating overly-nurturing dynamic of codependency in their entire tribe.

And if you're in it and you're feeding into it, on your journey one day you will look up and realize that you followed a tribe into a certain conformity and complacency that at one point felt good—you know, you're enjoying the cookies—but at some point you decide that you should have been on... you wake up and realize you should have been on a low carb diet.

The good thing with the hero dynamic... that it keeps you stuck is because you don't get to fail. And if you don't get to fail—like a lot, all day—you don't learn the cues that you're off wandering off your true path with an internal compass.

Think about what failure actually teaches you. Each time you fail and recover, you build confidence that you can handle the next failure. You learn what works and what doesn't. You calibrate your internal compass. You develop the resilience that only comes from surviving difficulty.

The Hero robs you of all that. Every time you're about to fail, they swoop in and save you. Which means you never learn that you could have saved yourself.

You practice and you practice and you practice, every day, every moment. When a cue comes up it's an opportunity to practice. When a cue comes up and it's an opportunity to run and call someone, you're fostering a codependency that leads to you eventually not unfolding to your full potential.

The reason it works that way—the reason a person gets pulled into that dynamic—is if they've gotten to the point in which they're less task-focused, they too feel a sense of stuckness. Then the rush of value-based decision-making, the rush of anticipating the sense of achievement that comes with each accomplishment is not as rewarding for them.

As such they develop what's called incentive salience. If you Google incentive salience you'll find that it's associated heavily with different types of addictions. In this case it's an addiction that we're going to call a codependency. You get addicted to the emotions that this person triggers in you and even if you walk away from that person there's a high probability that you will continue to fall into the pattern and look for surface cues in the next interaction that this is going to be a rather super nurturing person.

Where the growth comes into play is that when you commit to growth you develop the ability to create non-codependent interactions where you're communicating with the person in such a way that you're able to get the information from them without them damaging your self-worth.

**[MID-CHAPTER BRIDGE]**

Remember when I talked about being in alpha state versus beta state? The Hero keeps you calm—but it's a false calm. It's the calm of the poppy field.

---

The metaphor I think of—I think it's the Elysian Fields... or was it Ulysses that got caught in the Elysian Fields on his journey? But I'm thinking about the other dude... Prometheus...

I've been watching too many of these shows with my kids so the metaphors get conflated and again I have source amnesia. But I just know that the metaphor of the field of poppies where you fall asleep, time passes, and you forget what it is that you set out to do—and it feels decent.

That's the trap of being in a codependent suffocating relationship with a nurturer. It feels good.

Now the funny part about it is that when you're in a relationship with an over-suffocating nurturer and that's who you're using as your reality creation point—when you try to get independent, that's when you see the toxic aspect of it.

Because suddenly now this person, instead of acknowledging that you're now on your own path and you may need different mentors, new coaches, new approaches—they decide it's time to knock you down and knock you back into the victim position because they need you in that victim position. Because they need you to stick around.

It happens a lot in the coaching industry because we gravitate towards coaches that remind us of people from our past because it gives us that feeling that this is a safe place. Despite the fact that if you had a dysfunctional upbringing, you conflate love and guilt, love and shame. And you seek people who kind of lift you up on the surface but do subliminal shit to knock you down.

When you try to break away from an interaction with a nurturing person, then they're going to guilt you. A hyper-nurturing hero that can rescue you—they're going to guilt you. And as soon as you make the slightest mistakes and you fall down, they will swoop in hella quick to rescue.

Which essentially amplifies the shame. And it's a weird paradoxical shame amplification because you're like "This person is being so nice to me, why do I feel like utter horse shit?"

It's because the goal is to get to where you want to get to, that destiny. And somewhere on a subconscious level you know you're self-sabotaging by sitting here. Let someone pat your ass. Get up!

Pardon my French. I hope there are no children around. Most people who work with me know not to have children around when we're talking because it's real talk. I mean you can pass the lesson on to your kid but you might not want to get it from this messenger, right?

So it gets to where you get entrenched and embedded with this person who amplifies your fear so that they can keep you in the victim position. And it feels good because as soon as they remind you of who you were—keeping you trapped in the past—and get you to worry about this scary world out there, the very world that has kept them from developing a growth mindset and moving forward...

As soon as they give you your mind—clearly distracted by the fact you're no longer thinking about your vision—they've projected their vision complete with fear into you by using love.

So now you're conflating love and guilt. Because instead of making your decisions based off positive emotions, inspiration—when you feel that urge hit—you confuse it.

In that moment you feel guilty for the desire to be independent. And when we reach... what happens to us is when we have a negative emotion, in order to self-soothe we go inwards. We activate the representations of prior people that have helped us, prior people that have moved us along the way, and people who have been there during our formative time.

And when you activate this—if your internal model of other people and of how the world works has been broken by prior imprinting in your journey, by experiences that have taught you to stay trapped in identity—when you pull them up you may feel better. So you do get the self-soothing.

But you're not moving any closer to your goal.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

That's the Hero position. It feels like love, but it breeds dependency. It keeps you from failing—which means it keeps you from learning. And when you try to break free, the guilt pulls you back in. Now let's talk about the type of feedback that can break this cycle.

---

# CHAPTER 7: Evaluative vs Descriptive Feedback
*Estimated Runtime: 9 minutes | ~1,300 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

Now that we've covered all three positions on the Drama Triangle, I want to talk about something that determines whether you stay stuck or actually grow: the type of feedback you receive. This connects directly back to what we discussed about the Hero and the Villain—because the type of feedback they give is what keeps you trapped.

---

Now I want to say something specific about the "feel better" aspect. When we're talking about feel better, sometimes feeling bad feels better because the worst feeling is uncertainty.

Especially... there's studies about neuroticism. Neuroticism is intolerance to uncertainty to the point where you're willing to jump to a negative conclusion when it's not that bad and be like "Okay, I'll take this. This is what happened."

That's not what happened. This is what you decided happened so that you can cope and eliminate the uncertainty.

You've taken an opportunity and made it into a threat. You reacted to a threat and you shortened your future. You've decreased your potential you can reach by no longer seeing the opportunities, the affordances, as I mentioned earlier, in the moment.

This brings us to the topic of feedback—because the type of feedback you receive and internalize determines whether you stay stuck or whether you grow.

There's two types of feedback—this is a rough cut, there's always some categories of all these different things—but for now, for rough cuts, there are two types of feedback you need to be attentive to: evaluative feedback and descriptive feedback.

**Evaluative Feedback:** Evaluative feedback conflates the task with your identity. Evaluative feedback is where someone tells you that you did the task well and then they slip in suggestions that you are a good person as a result of doing the task well.

In the mindset literature it locks you into a fixed mindset. This is when you tell someone they're smart when they do well as opposed to when you tell them that you admire the effort they put in and acknowledge that this was a challenging task—so that they continue to focus on being purpose, value, decision, and action based.

They start to believe that life is more about doing and presenting this mask than it is about being and discovering and acting on your inspiration, your urges, and your true self.

This is where you often hear people talking about separating from ego, disconnecting from ego, and listening to your intuition.

An urge comes up and the urge, before it's in your conscious mind, it doesn't have either of those words attached to it. Those concepts haven't been activated yet.

It's when you decide in the moment that something feels bad or good to the point where it's either a pleasure or pain that keeps you bound to the circumstance, bound to the outside environment—that's the point at which an urge becomes a manifestation of your intuition. Because you pull back what you believe, you pull back an opportunity based on... you pull back an action chain, an intentional set of action.

And you take action based on what you've told yourself is either what you will do in this situation, or if it's an absolute new situation and you can't think of any similar situations, your brain is coming up blank—you make a choice based on your values. What is most important. And those values don't collapse into being ego defensive.

As such you don't fall for the ego narrative. You don't start telling yourself a story that gives you permission to either drop into the victim position or to pop up into the villain position and develop the cynical negative life view with the belief that you're stuck. Also you don't tell yourself stories that lead to you popping into the hero position where you start looking for other people who are equally stuck and feeding them all kinds of feel-good information knowing that you haven't achieved the thing that you're telling them about—you just know how to feel good, stuck in that state.

That's the suffocating codependent nurturing. And so you end up building a tribe that is stuck with you. And you can build a business that way. You can make money that way. A lot of your cults and sub-religions and even brands for products that aren't really effective work just like that.

I know that sounds super abstract and y'all know I like the formulas and models and math. So if you want to geek out and know the math under all this I got you.

The models we can use are... Karl Friston has a free energy model—they call it the active inference model of consciousness—which breaks all this down.

Where if you could find someone you could trust who is doing something that you want to do, your brain allows you to go into hyper-imitation mode. You can do downloads from the universe, as some people say, where you model what the person in front of you is doing with full trust.

You can't do that with evaluative feedback because part of modeling the person's mind to get that information involves modeling how they see you and how they perceive you. And if someone's giving you evaluative feedback, part of the full model of their mind involves insults to you and involves a model of you, a reflection of you, in which you are incapable of getting the desired outcome.

So basically modeling that person's mind gets you stuck when their feedback is evaluative instead of descriptive.

**Descriptive Feedback:** Now descriptive feedback is specific. I've talked about this before but it's worth repeating.

Descriptive feedback means if I've come to you and I'm lost and I say, "I'm trying to get to New York and I'm heading north and I'm in Canada"—or somewhere between the two but heading north in the wrong direction—descriptive feedback is like: "Hey, you know what I've had success with when I got to New York is I took this road. It took me about this number of hours. Actually I made the same mistake—that's why you see me with a house here because last time I got lost and ended up here. I had a moment of serendipity and realized I liked it here. But that's not where you want to be, stuck here. Your goal in the moment is to get to New York. You get to New York that way. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you the best of luck."

Descriptive feedback can be something as simple as: change your angle, focus on something different, change your attitude, get more rest.

And by "change your attitude" I don't mean insulting your attitude but pointing out to you—my coach says from a place of love as opposed to from a place of fear—"I have positive emotions about you. I feel good about you. I see the specific mistakes you're making. I've made them too. I feel this... has a compassion and I understand. I'm not judging you and devaluing you as a person."

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

That's the difference: evaluative feedback makes it about who you are, descriptive feedback makes it about what you're doing. One locks you into identity defense, the other gives you actionable information. Now let's talk about what happens when you internalize the wrong type of feedback and create an inner critic.

---

# CHAPTER 8: The Inner Critic & What You Attract
*Estimated Runtime: 11 minutes | ~1,600 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

Everything we've discussed so far has been about external dynamics—interactions with other people. But here's where it gets deeper: those external dynamics eventually become internal ones. The Villains and Heroes in your life become voices in your head. And those voices determine what you attract.

---

Basically the main point is that—remember I said earlier that these models we split into, these multiple models in our minds—

After you walk away from this person who has this dysfunctional interaction, you walk away with a sense of lower self-efficacy. Or you walk away and that's when you internalize it. That's what they call an internalizing disorder where you're like "Oh, something's wrong with me."

And as such you strive lower for at least a few minutes after you interact with the person. And based on if they hooked into something from your childhood that is a deep enough wound, it stays with you so that you feel like you are a broken person in a cruel world. And that's what you draw. And you're less likely to take action.

You're less likely to learn from your mistakes because even as you do approach behavior to try to get something that you know you want, you do it in a reticent way such that you decrease the likelihood that the outcome that you get from the action in that moment is in alignment with your true capabilities and up to your potential.

And then you see yourself doing less than you know you can inside and then it feeds into that feedback loop of feeling lesser than, feeling unworthy, feeling undeserving, feeling out of integrity, feeling disempowered.

What I wanted to underscore—and again I'm super non-linear so I'm holding these multiple thoughts and I'm multi-threading between them to make sure I close each loop. In the written version after my editor gets to it it'll be less painful. If you're a non-linear thinker then you're riding with me, it's extra fun. Then you could probably work with me better one-on-one. If you can't do the non-linear then you're not a good candidate for coaching with me because it would grab you bad. There's that.

So the damage that happens with dealing with toxic people and dysfunctional interactions is that when you internalize these models, one of two things happen:

1. You either believe something is wrong with you—which is an internalization disorder

2. Or you believe that the world is cruel, selfish, and hateful, judgmental. And as such you internalize this model of a hyperactive inner critic where you have this negative criticizing self-talk that is really there to defend you, to protect you from this dangerous world. And it's running all the time.

Let me describe what this feels like from the inside.

You wake up in the morning. Before your feet hit the floor, the voice is already running. "You're not going to get everything done today. You never do. Remember what happened last time? You're probably going to mess this up too. Everyone's going to see you're a fraud."

That's not depression. That's not anxiety. That's an internalized Villain—a voice you created to protect yourself from external criticism by beating yourself up first.

The twisted logic is: if I criticize myself first, it won't hurt as much when they do it.

That goes back, knocks you to this beta state where your higher frequency loops are with a focus on the outside world, danger, looking for, scanning the environment for danger, never getting the opportunity—or at least less frequently getting the opportunity—to shift your system into a parasympathetic, relaxed, present, truth-focused mode where you're doing the introspection: "Who am I really? What are the things that I want really? What are the steps that I believe will lead to it? What are the dangers that I believe exist between here and my win, and my destiny?"

Because they're my dangers. You know, I can either stop here, freeze in life, and live a half-assed life, or face these fears and use these fears as a sign, as an opportunity to develop character and courage.

So distraction from your goal links to you having a bunch of these threat-based and frankly irrelevant ideas. It leads to what they call accumulating enough stress to get an executive dysfunction—stress-induced executive dysfunction is the word they're using out in the world now. It's another way of saying you're stuck.

So if the stress lasts long enough then it becomes that you have an anxiety disorder—whether it's a generalized anxiety disorder where you walk around all the damn time with anxiety, or a social anxiety disorder if you developed an internal model of a cruel world where your inner critic comes to life.

Really, like you have a really low threshold... your inner critic is easily activated. And as such in most interactions you tap out. In moments of intimacy, due to the uncertainty, because you assume that the unknown is going to end up with this person being another cruel person.

Now the importance of that is that you end up interpreting new events as threats instead of opportunities. That's the part that's damaging.

And then when you're alone, listen to yourself talk when you're alone. They call this self-alienation. It's like if you divided yourself into these two parts where there's one that doesn't believe you can do it and has that self-doubt even for a moment, and then if you rapidly have this inner critic that pounces in and starts beating you up or whatever, saying "Oh you can't do it," negative thought negative thought, negative talk negative talk...

If that kicks in early, you either hear it inside yourself and you get angry and you're disconnected from what's happening outside because the inner critic is so loud, or you do what's called projective identification where you allow and attract people to your life that sound like this so that you can get that positive closure. You can get the coherence that what you believe exists truthfully in the world.

You attract what you think about. You attract what you believe.

You start attracting villains into your life if at some point your life develops belief that this is all that you're deserving of—and that you can't work without kicking yourself, feeling guilty, in that angry negative self-talk—and the belief that it's coming anyway from someone.

That you start to imagine them. You get that cortisol rush, you get the adrenaline rush, and then suddenly you find yourself productive. And you get used to that way of being in life and you assume about yourself that you don't have initiative. And so you need this internal voice that you've basically created that is more amplified and probably crueler than anyone outside in the real world because it knows so much about you—because it's a product of your imagination and as such it's been watching you all your life.

Or you create the internal voice of the nurturer—the hero.

Now the subtle aspect of the hero that makes it such a trap is that it's a loving, loving voice in your mind. But if you dig into it, behind it you're revealing a limiting belief that you can't accomplish this destiny.

So "I'm gonna love you all for it, okay, and stay here with me, and it's safe." And you get to put that shit in your head and you stay there.

Because you don't feel bad enough and you numb the discomfort to the point where you're not activating yourself. That's the trap. And it feels good.

Both voices—the inner Villain and the inner Hero—keep you stuck. One through pain, one through comfort. But stuck is stuck.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

So the Drama Triangle doesn't just exist between you and other people. It exists inside your own head—as internalized voices that either criticize you or comfort you into staying stuck. And these inner voices determine what you attract externally. Now let's talk about breaking this cycle by finding the right tribe.

---

# CHAPTER 9: Finding Your True Tribe
*Estimated Runtime: 9 minutes | ~1,300 words*

---

**[CHAPTER OPENING]**

We've covered a lot of ground—brain loops, dysfunctional interactions, the three Drama Triangle positions, feedback types, and how all of this gets internalized. Now let's talk about the solution: surrounding yourself with people who actually help you grow instead of keeping you stuck.

---

And then you develop the habit of being stuck in that loop. You decrease your self-efficacy, decrease your self-esteem. You gravitate less towards self-acceptance and self-love and more towards a self-esteem mask-based approach to life where you pour so much energy into the social image and social performances that you lack the attention—and thus the energy—to go inwards, clarify your values, know what you believe, get clear on your strengths, know your weaknesses.

So what's the alternative? What does it look like to break this pattern?

Surround yourself with a team of people who make sure that when you're operating in your zone of genius, your zone of excellence, that they reinforce you, keep you focused on the vision, so that you remain attuned on an unconscious level to the opportunities and the relevant things coming into your life.

The goal essentially is to make sure that you're on this path, that you have this vision, and that even when you unplug from the vision so you can see it from a different perspective, you're still on the path to that vision just with more wisdom.

What's next is clarifying your values and clarifying your strengths.

Because once you are clear on your values you can act in integrity. Which essentially means: you know what you want, you know how to articulate it, you know how to act on what you say—so your word is your bond.

And it's not just words out loud but it's words that you put on your calendar, it's words that you write in your journal, your aspirations.

Those things—when you shift to the right frame of mind—those things become a magnetic pull. You enter... whoa... challenges, opportunities show up where what would be a threat becomes a challenge because you're able to self-soothe.

This is where all the self-love and self-acceptance comes in. When you go inwards you activate your values and activating your values leads to you enacting your values, making decisions based on those values. You're more likely to step into those actions because they're actions that you feel good about.

And then you're more likely to attract a tribe that is healthily nurturing, who maintains psychic boundaries. And even when you have moments where your vision kind of fumbles a bit and you have a little self-doubt, you can turn to them. And since they share your vision, they honestly believe in it. Plus they have a positive expectancy of the desired outcome. They're not playing the drama dance. They're task-focused, they're outcome-focused. And as such they help you return the focus.

Let me paint a picture of what this feels like.

Imagine you have people in your life who, when you come to them with an idea, they get curious. Not threatened. Not dismissive. Curious. "Tell me more about that. What made you think of it? What would it take to test it?"

When you fail—and you will fail—they don't swoop in to rescue you or criticize you. They ask, "What did you learn? What would you do differently?" They trust you to figure it out. And if you ask for help, they help—but they don't take over.

When you succeed, they celebrate with you without making it about them. They don't need your success to validate their role in your life. They're genuinely happy because they care about your growth, not about being needed.

This is how we use the collective conscious to focus. We find tribes with an aspirational identity that are not only headed to where we want but are making choices based on values that we share such that when we get to the goal we are whole, we have grown, we are more in alignment with who we are.

So that the process—you know, a lot of people aren't just "the grind the grind the grind"—that's crap.

Your process is gradual. It's an incremental iterative process that involves every day having accountability with people who love you enough and believe in you enough to continue even when you're flat on your back—to see your best self, to remind you and reflect the truth of what mistakes you made in the moment without adding their own issues into it and hooking into your wounds and getting that good feeling from knowing on a subconscious level that what they said or done to you is causing you enough pain to keep you stuck in that relationship.

As opposed to perceiving the true abundance that exists in reality in the here and now and the opportunities and affordances that go with it.

Here's how you recognize your true tribe:

After you leave an interaction with them, you feel more capable—not less.

They give you specific feedback, not vague judgment.

They challenge you from a place of belief in you, not from doubt.

They don't need you to stay stuck for them to feel valuable.

They celebrate your independence, not just your dependence on them.

When you find these people—and they do exist—protect those relationships. Invest in them. Let them see you struggle and grow. That's where real transformation happens.

**[CHAPTER CLOSE]**

That's what a healthy tribe looks like: people who reflect your truth, give you descriptive feedback, and support your independence. Finding them is one of the most important things you can do for your ability to execute. Now let me tell you about what comes next.

**[CLOSING BRIDGE]**

So here's the thing.

Everything I just taught you—the Drama Triangle, the three positions, the difference between evaluative and descriptive feedback, the inner critic dynamics, what it means to find your true tribe—all of that is valuable. If you take nothing else from this, you now have a framework for recognizing when you're in a dysfunctional pattern.

But here's what I've learned from working with over 870 clients: understanding the pattern is not the same as breaking the pattern.

---

You can recognize that you're in the Victim position and still stay there. You can see the Hero trap for what it is and still fall into it. You can know intellectually that your inner critic is just an internalized voice from the past—and that voice can still run your life.

Why?

Because self-sabotage isn't a mindset problem. It's not a discipline problem. It's not a willpower problem.

It's an identity prediction problem.

Your brain is a prediction machine. It's constantly running simulations about what's going to happen next. And those predictions aren't based on the truth of who you are now—they're based on outdated models formed in childhood, in past relationships, in past failures.

Your subconscious believes certain things about who you are and what you deserve. And as long as those predictions stay in place, no amount of insight is going to change your behavior. You'll keep self-sabotaging because your brain is trying to make reality match its predictions.

The only way to create lasting change is to update the brain's predictive model. Not through willpower. Not through affirmations. Through emotional reconsolidation—the process of activating an old memory or belief, creating an emotional mismatch, and allowing the brain to update its prediction.

That's what I do with my clients. That's what the Inner Architect System is built to do.

Here's what's included:

**The Inner Architect Curriculum**—a three-phase, nine-lesson transformation based on emotional reconsolidation and predictive identity rewiring. This isn't theory. This is the actual process I use with clients to dissolve self-sabotage at the identity level.

**Monthly Deep-Dive Workshop Sessions**—every second Saturday, we do a live two-and-a-half-hour guided intensive. Real-time case studies. Belief shifting in a co-regulated space. This is where the deep work happens.

**Weekly Drop-In Coaching Sessions**—ninety minutes every week for direct personal coaching and real-time application. You bring what you're stuck on, we work through it together.

**An AI-Powered Lesson Agent**—an interactive guide that walks you through all nine lessons, tailored to your situation. So you're never stuck between sessions wondering what to do next.

**An Implementation Community Off Facebook**—a focused, worldview-aligned space for discussion and breakthroughs. No drama. No noise. Just people who are actually doing the work.

And as a bonus, I teach the group how to vibe code—how to build quick tools to help organize your mind. I've been building software since 2008. Left psychiatry residency to do game design and virtual worlds. That technical thinking has become part of how I do transformation work. You'll see me build tools live, and if you want to learn, you can pick it up too.

Now, who is this not for?

It's not for people who want someone else to fix them. I can guide you, but you have to do the work.

It's not for people who can't handle direct feedback. I'm not going to coddle you.

It's not for people who need hand-holding on every decision. The goal is to build your internal compass, not replace it with me.

It's not for people who want polished corporate coaching. That's not how I operate. I think non-linearly, I curse when it's real, and I filter hard. Not everyone is a fit.

But if you're a high-performing analytical empath who keeps self-sabotaging despite knowing better—if you're smart enough to understand your patterns but stuck in them anyway—if you're ready to dissolve self-sabotage at the identity level without burning out or betraying yourself...

This is what I built. This is who I built it for.

There's a fourteen-day full refund guarantee. If you go through the material and it's not for you, you keep the bonuses and get your money back. I don't want your money if this isn't the right fit.

But if it is the right fit—if you're ready to stop the drama dance, update your brain's predictions, and actually execute on the vision you've been carrying—this is how we do it.

Dr. Mani, out.
