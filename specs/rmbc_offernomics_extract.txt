AND LET’S LOOK AT SOME MORE DATA:
964 Users Hit the Landing Page from FB Ads
10 Conversions
1.04% conversion rate. 
Ad Spend = $3,000
CPA = $300

What Questions Would I Ask
Right Away?
I’d want to know benchmarks.
Is this conversion rate good? Is this CPA high,
low, or average? What’s the benchmark?
I would find that out by asking people who are
running traffic to this kind of offer, or to
friends who own this kind of offer, or in a
mastermind (and this is a big value of
masterminds and paid groups with high-level
people - they can give you benchmarks and
save you a ton of time). 

Let’s say that in this instance,
we know that the conversion
rate from competitors is
higher…
We also know from friends running traffic to
competitors that their CPA is much lower (as
low as $100). 
Now, we have a rough benchmark of what to
optimize towards. 

So, how do we optimize?
A few options here…
If you’ve got Google Analytics installed throughout your funnel,
you might be able to see where users (prospects) are falling off.
You could also just test a new front-end copy (what a lot of
people do)…
Or do CRO split-tests (buttons, page elements, messaging,
moving around testimonials, page design, etc - also what a lot
of people do).
All of those things can help increase conversions…
But the part to keep in mind is what conversion really means: 
A higher conversion rate = a lower CPA = more scale and more
profit. 

M o s t  o f  t h e  t i m e  y o u r  a n s w e r  i s  g o i n g  t o  b e :
\
OK, SO IN THE CASE OF THE PEPTIDE FUNNEL…
Looking at my competitor’s pages, I realize that their customer journey (flow) has a lot
less friction than ours. 
So my thesis is that by simplifying our “flow” (aka a Quiz), I can probably double
conversion rates.
If I’m right, new metrics on that same amount of ad spend would look like this: 
964 Users Hit the Landing Page
10 20 Conversions
2.08% conversion rate. 
$3k Ad Spend: 
CPA = $300 $150
That’s a massive difference, obviously. 

M o s t  o f  t h e  t i m e  y o u r  a n s w e r  i s  g o i n g  t o  b e :
\
LET’S GO BACK TO OUR INITIAL NUMBERS AND
SEE WHAT THIS WOULD MEAN: 
Real World Example - Peptides (GLP-1) - After First Optimization
How Much Does It Cost Me To Acquire A Customer on Average? (CPA/CAC)
$300 $150
How Much Money Do I Gross On Day 0 When I Acquire That Customer On
Average? (AOV)
$299
What Is My Cost to Fulfill A Customer’s Order on Average (COGS)
$145
What Is My Gross Profit When I Acquire That Customer? (GM)
-$146 $5

So, how do we optimize?
That certainly doesn’t seem like life-changing money…
Although, actually, it would be because of the rebills
and LTV for this market, and we’ll get to that in a little
bit. 
Regardless, though, this would be a huge win…
And you often CAN find opportunities to double your
conversions through testing.
However, if you can’t, doing a bunch of little
incremental tests can also lead to new wins.

Let’s assume this test works. 
The flow is simplified; I double conversions, and
I’m now at a $150 CPA.
I could stop there, get scale, and be fat and
happy (because of the rebills, which I’ll talk
about soon).
But realistically, there is just so much more low-
hanging fruit here. 
Let’s say that by testing some different
variants of the landing page (copy, design, and
elements), I can increase the conversion rate
up to 2.50%. 

M o s t  o f  t h e  t i m e  y o u r  a n s w e r  i s  g o i n g  t o  b e :
\
NOW MY NUMBERS LOOK LIKE THIS:
964 Users Hit the Landing Page

2.50% conversion Rate

CPA = $150 $125

THIS MAKES MY NEW NUMBERS THE FOLLOWING:

What Is My Cost to Fulfill A Customer’s Order on Average (COGS)
$145
What Is My Gross Profit When I Acquire That Customer? (GM)
-$146 $5 $20
That doesn’t seem like a fortune either…

But now, let’s say I’m doing
1,000 front-ends a day. 
That’s $20k Gross Profit Per Day. 
$600k a Month. 

All right, so realistically, with more landing page
tests, etc., I could probably get my conversion
rate up to 3%, but for now, let’s just keep it at
2.5% and say we’re happy for the time being.
What else can I be doing?

One really low-hanging fruit would be abandoned carts
and declines. 
In the case of the peptide company, let’s say we’re getting 300
abandoned carts daily.
A pretty standard conversion rate for a call center hitting your
abandoned carts is about 20%...
But let’s just say that our outbound call center is converting
10% to keep this moderate…
And let’s say we’re paying our call center $125 per conversion. 
Let’s also say that our text and emails to our abandoned carts
convert another 5% of abandons (and those are free)
So now we’re getting another 30 sales per day from the call center,
and our “CPA” is $125 per sale, so that’s $3,750 in “ad spend.” 
Plus, we’re getting 15 sales from our abandon cart texts and emails
at “no” CPA.

01 What Is The Lifetime Value Of That Customer? (LTV)

02 What Is The Average Additional Expected

Two More Questions to Answer:

M o s t  o f  t h e  t i m e  y o u r  a n s w e r  i s  g o i n g  t o  b e :
\
WE CAN LOOK AT THIS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PEPTIDE
COMPANY AGAIN
Real World Example - Peptides (GLP-1) - After Third Optimization, With LTV Factored In:
How Much Does It Cost Me To Acquire A Customer on Average? (CPA/CAC)
$300 $150 $125 $97.82

$299
What Is My Cost to Fulfill A Customer’s Order on Average (COGS)
$145
What Is My Gross Profit When I Acquire That Customer? (GM)
-$146 $5 $20 $56.18
What Is The Lifetime Value Of That Customer? (LTV)
$2,000
What Is The Average Additional Expected Lifetime Gross Profit of The Customer?
$1,000
*It’s Also Helpful to Know How Long the LTV Lasts. For example, with peptides, let’s say that LTV is over
about 6 months.
This means we’re getting an extra $166 per month for each of these customers for the next 6 months. 

So we start with these numbers:
30,000 Customers Month 1:
Gross Profit Per Day = $20k
$56,180
Gross Profit Per Month = $500k  
$1,685,400

And Let’s Say We Do Another 30,000
Customers In Month 2: 
Gross Profit Per Day = $56,180
Gross Profit Per Month = $1,685,400
PLUS Because of Those Rebills We Do:
30,000 x $166 = $4,980,000 Additional Gross Profit In
Month 2
= Month Two Total Gross Profit = $6,665,400
Why is Gross Profit So Much Higher for the Rebills? 
Because there are ZERO ad costs in this example. You
acquire them once but get to keep rebilling them. 

And if you want to really have your mind
blown, let’s expand this out over another
month:
Let’s Say We Do Another 30,000 Customers In Month 3: 
Gross Profit Per Day = $56,180
Gross Profit Per Month = $1,685,400
PLUS:
60,000 x $166 =$9.96MM Additional Gross Profit In
Month 2
Month Three Total Gross Profit = $11,645,400

I know those numbers are insane, but they’re not out of
the question. 
And of course, it’s like, let’s say you only get to 100 sales per day in a model
like this: 
Okay, so in month three, you’re “only” netting $1,164,540. Oh NO :( 
This is why people love subscription businesses. 
Remember that this doesn’t take into account all the
other ways you can increase LTV either…
Like: 
Increase stick rate (gifts, better comms, etc)
Email list monetization - affiliates, warm promos, etc.
Phone sales/texts to bigger packages
Now, hopefully, this is changing the ways you look at
funnel economics and really running a business in
general. 

Look at this in action from a bad day early on:
6 Sales from FB on $1,970.93 spend =$328 CPA. 
Add in 8 Phone Sales from the call center at a $125 CPA per. ($1000 commission)
$2,970.93 spend
14 Sales 
=$212.21 CPA. 
Now Add in Organic/Coupon Code Sales:
1 Sale Text Coupon Code (Save 100) - $299
1 Sale Organic/Unattributed $399
1 Sale Email Coupon Code (Email 100) $299
$2,970.93 spend
17 Sales
=$174.76 CPA
===
5x Rebill at $399
Let’s say $220 NP on Average = $1,100 Net Profit on the Rebills

01 Maximize Net Profit (Volume + Percentage)
HOW MUCH ARE YOU WILLING TO
SPEND TO ACQUIRE A CUSTOMER?
02 Maximize Revenue (For Acquisition)
03 Maximize New Customers (Lead-Gen or Acquisition)
Lifestyle (High Margin, Low Headache)04

Keeping in mind the continuity component and LTV, in theory, for peptides, we should be
willing to go negative for a lot of money to acquire customers. This is a pretty proven model,
too, ie. Agora is famous for going negative for several months due to LTV. You need a lot of
upfront money to play that game, though, or enough predictable rebills coming in to do it. 
The pro of going negative is that you acquire MORE customers and dominate your
market. In this case, you’re typically going to end up paying a higher CPA and be HAPPY
about it. 
My personal philosophy is that I’d rather not go negative unless there’s a very compelling
reason, but I get it. 
Also, even if I am going negative, I’m still working to optimize CPAs and lower them. 
Finally, typically, CPAs do go up with more scale, especially when you go to broader channels
(billboards vs. direct response), so that’s another reason where you might want to “go
negative” - but it also depends on your goals.
