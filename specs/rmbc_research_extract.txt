Market and Product Awareness: 
Understanding Your Audience's Journey
Welcome to the research modules of RMBC2, where we'll explore the critical concept of market and product awareness. This 
framework, popularized by Eugene Schwartz in Breakthrough Advertising, has become increasingly important in modern 
marketing. Understanding where your audience sits on the awareness spectrum is crucial for crafting effective copy that 
resonates with your target market. This document will guide you through the five stages of awareness, explain why they 
matter, and provide practical examples to help you identify and address your audience's specific needs.


The Five Stages of Awareness
Unaware
Prospects are not even aware of a problem or need that your product or service can solve. They go about their daily 
lives without recognizing any issues that need addressing.
Problem-Aware
Prospects recognize that they have a problem or need, but are unaware of potential solutions. They know something is 
wrong but don't know what to do about it.
Solution-Aware
Prospects know that solutions exist for their problem, but they are not yet aware of your specific solution. They 
understand there are ways to address their issue but don't know which approach is best.
Product-Aware
Prospects know about your solution category (your product or service type) and are evaluating its features and 
benefits. They're researching different options within the category.
Most-Aware
Prospects are highly aware of your specific solution, its benefits, and are likely to make a purchase decision soon. They 
know your brand, understand your approach, and need minimal convincing.
Understanding these stages is crucial because they determine how you should craft your marketing messages. The journey 
from unaware to most-aware represents the path your prospects take before becoming customers, and your copy needs to 
meet them where they are.


Why Awareness Matters in Copywriting
When creating copy for various marketing assets4whether ads, landing pages, VSLs, or emails4it's essential to understand 
where in the journey your target market is. The average person you're targeting may be at any stage of awareness, and your 
copy needs to address them appropriately.
The gap between awareness stages isn't equal. Moving someone from unaware to problem-aware is significantly more 
challenging than moving them from product-aware to most-aware. This is why direct response marketing typically doesn't 
target the unaware segment4it's too resource-intensive and yields lower conversion rates.
Who's Most Likely to Buy?
Most-aware prospects are the easiest to convert because 
they already know your brand and are close to making a 
purchase decision. However, they typically represent only 
about 1% of your total addressable market (TAM), even for 
well-known brands.
Product-aware prospects (those familiar with your product 
category) are the next best segment, but they might only 
represent 10-15% of your TAM. The solution-aware and 
problem-aware segments are much larger but require more 
education before they're ready to buy.
1%
Most-Aware

that knows your specific 
brand and is ready to buy

about your product 
category
99%
Solution-Aware

problem

Percentage that recognizes 
they have a problem
The key insight is that your marketing approach should differ dramatically based on which awareness stage you're targeting. 
The copy that works for most-aware prospects will fail with problem-aware prospects, and vice versa.


The Buyer's Journey: Steps to Purchase
Understanding the buyer's journey is crucial for effective copywriting. Each step from unaware to purchase represents a 
significant mental shift for your prospect, and your copy needs to facilitate these transitions.
Recognize the Problem
The prospect must first acknowledge they have an issue that needs solving. This is the transition from unaware to 
problem-aware.
Seek Solutions
Once aware of their problem, prospects begin looking for ways to solve it, becoming solution-aware in the process.
Discover Product Categories
Prospects learn about specific types of products or services that can address their needs, becoming product-
aware.
Evaluate Specific Brands
After understanding the product category, prospects research specific brands and offerings, becoming most-
aware of particular solutions.
Make Purchase Decision
Finally, prospects decide which specific solution to buy, completing their journey from awareness to customer.
The first step4moving from unaware to problem-aware4is typically the largest and most difficult. This is why traditional 
advertising, educational content, and brand-building efforts often focus on this transition, while direct response marketing 
targets prospects who are already at least problem-aware.


Real-World Example: Peptide Eye Serum
Let's examine how awareness stages apply to a specific product: a peptide eye serum targeted at women 35+.
Awareness Stage Customer Mindset
Unaware A 38-year-old woman goes about her daily routine 
without noticing or thinking about the fine lines around 
her eyes. She might catch glimpses in the mirror but 
doesn't register any changes or concerns about aging. Eye 
cream isn't even on her radar.
Problem-Aware She starts noticing crow's feet in photos or catches herself 
in harsh lighting and thinks, "When did I start looking so 
tired?" She's aware something has changed around her 
eyes but doesn't know what to do about it.
Solution-Aware She knows eye creams exist and that there are anti-aging 
treatments available. She's seen ads for various skincare 
products and knows people use things like retinol, 
hyaluronic acid, and cosmetic procedures, but doesn't 
know which approach is best.
Product-Aware She's learned about peptides specifically for eye care and 
knows that peptide-based eye creams are a category of 
anti-aging products. She understands peptides can help 
with collagen production and fine lines.
Most-Aware She knows about your specific peptide eye cream brand, 
has researched your company's approach, understands 
your unique formulation and benefits, and is ready to 
make a purchase decision.
For this product, nearly all women in the target demographic are solution-aware (they know skincare products exist), but a 
smaller percentage are product-aware (they know about peptide eye creams specifically). The most effective marketing would 
likely target the problem-aware and solution-aware segments, educating them about peptides as an effective solution for their 
aging concerns.


Marketing Mistakes: Mismatching 
Awareness Levels
One common marketing mistake is creating copy that targets the wrong awareness level. The presenter shared a personal 
example about marketing a whipped tallow skincare product. Despite writing compelling copy about the product's texture, 
scent, and benefits, the ads didn't perform as well as expected.
The Mistake
The copy assumed prospects were already product-aware4
that they knew what beef tallow was and why it would be 
beneficial for skin. In reality, most prospects were only 
problem-aware or solution-aware. They knew they wanted 
better skin, and they knew skincare products existed, but 
they had no idea what beef tallow was or why they should 
put it on their face.
The ads failed to bridge this knowledge gap by educating 
prospects about why beef tallow is an effective skincare 
ingredient. Without this educational component, prospects 
couldn't move from solution-aware to product-aware.
The Solution
A better approach would have been to create copy that 
educated prospects about beef tallow's benefits:
Rich in omega fatty acids that support the skin barrier
Contains vitamins A, D, K, and E that naturally occur in 
healthy skin
Has anti-inflammatory properties to help reduce 
inflammation
Recommended by dermatologists for dry skin conditions
Provides hydration while protecting the skin's barrier
This educational approach would help move prospects from 
solution-aware to product-aware, making them more 
receptive to the benefits described in the original copy.
The key lesson is that your copy needs to meet prospects where they are in their awareness journey. If they don't understand 
why your product category is valuable, they won't care about the specific features and benefits of your brand.


Contrasting Examples: GLP-1 Medications 
vs. NAD+
Different products require different marketing approaches based on market awareness. The presenter contrasted two 
telemedicine products to illustrate this point:
GLP-1 Medications (Ozempic, etc.)
Nearly everyone is already product-aware. They've heard 
of Ozempic and know what GLP-1 medications do for 
weight loss. Marketing can be simple and direct: "Get GLP-
1 medication, save $100 off your first month. " No 
education needed4just focus on convenience, price, and 
trust.
NAD+ Injections
Most people are unaware or only problem-aware. They 
don't know what NAD+ is or why they would want it. 
Marketing requires significant education about what 
NAD+ does, its anti-aging benefits, and why injections are 
effective. This demands longer copy, advertorials, or VSLs.
The results were predictable: The GLP-1 marketing performed well with minimal copy, while the NAD+ marketing struggled 
despite using the same approach. The only channel where NAD+ performed adequately was Google Search, where users were 
already product-aware (actively searching for NAD+).
This example demonstrates why understanding market awareness is crucial for determining your marketing approach. 
Products with high awareness can use simpler, more direct marketing, while products with low awareness require educational 
content to move prospects through the awareness stages.


Additional Examples and Practical 
Applications
Eco-Friendly Cleaning Products
For eco-friendly cleaning products, awareness levels vary significantly. Many consumers are problem-aware (they notice skin 
reactions or are concerned about chemicals) but aren't necessarily solution-aware about green cleaning alternatives. Others 
may be solution-aware but skeptical about effectiveness or price. Your marketing needs to address these concerns differently:
For problem-aware prospects: "The surprising reason your child's skin rashes keep coming back4and it's hiding in your 
cleaning cabinet. "
For solution-aware prospects: "Yes, eco-friendly cleaners actually work4here's how our plant-based formula outperforms 
chemical cleaners without the toxic residue. "
For product-aware prospects: "Why our eco-friendly cleaner has 2x the cleaning power with half the environmental 
impact of other green brands. "
Personal Branding Mastermind
For a personal branding program targeting professionals, the awareness journey might look like this:
1Problem-Aware (30%)
"Why am I getting passed over for promotions 
despite working harder than everyone else?"
2 Solution-Aware (10%)
"I've noticed personal branding helps careers, but it 
seems complicated and time-consuming. "
3Product-Aware (5%)
"I'm researching personal branding programs and 
masterminds to help advance my career. "
4 Most-Aware (1%)
"I'm comparing your mastermind to two others 
before making my final decision. "
The key takeaway is that understanding your audience's awareness level is fundamental to creating effective copy. As you 
develop marketing materials, always ask: "Where is my audience in their awareness journey, and how can my copy meet them 
there?" This approach will help you craft messages that resonate with your prospects and guide them toward becoming 
customers.
