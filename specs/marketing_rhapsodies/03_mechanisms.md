00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.939
Copy Accelerator: Hello to everybody coming on board.
2
00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.910
Copy Accelerator: But online.
3
00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.629
Copy Accelerator: we will begin started in just a minute or so. Gonna 
let some more people in.
4
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.990
Copy Accelerator: We're in
5
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.850
Copy Accelerator: okay, people in.
6
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.830
Leonidas Ntousias: Hello! Everyone.
7
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.350
Copy Accelerator: Hey? How you doing.
8
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.940
Leonidas Ntousias: Oh!
9
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:48.370
Copy Accelerator: Good.
10
00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:04.525
Copy Accelerator: I'm sure more people will kind of come in, as 
usually happens. But yep, in fact, as soon as I start talking, the 
person today, we're gonna be going over background stories and unique 
mechanisms. And specifically how they pertain to
11
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.539
Copy Accelerator: sales, letters and video sales letters. I have

12
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.340
Copy Accelerator: 3 examples at least. We'll go through one
13
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:28.700
Copy Accelerator: medium length, 1 1 full length, one that's in the 
health space, and then one full length, one that is in the biz OP. 
Space and we'll kind of look at those as examples. Maybe we'll look at 
some others as well
14
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:34.039
Copy Accelerator: as usual before we get started, though. Would love 
to hear if anybody has
15
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:57.168
Copy Accelerator: a when that they wanna share, we do this at the 
start of every call of every week. So if you've got anything cool, you 
wanna share when you've got your business, or you know, as a team 
member of a business, you know whether it could be, you know, an ad 
that's working, or a metric that's going well, or, you know, just kind 
of that. You did something faster than before. Anything like that 
would love to hear it, feel free to unmute yourself or put it in the 
chat. And
16
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.600
Copy Accelerator: I would love to hear it.
17
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:10.149
stefanbaciu: Yeah. Actually, I wanna say that we wrote to advertorials 
so we could go after some swipes that you gave us. And they're 
actually performing
18
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.780
stefanbaciu: like pretty well. So.
19
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:12.650
Copy Accelerator: Nice, so.
20
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.520
stefanbaciu: 1st ones, and it's exciting to see that they
21

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.869
stefanbaciu: they seem to be doing good. That's fun.
22
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:34.139
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. I looked at one of those 
yesterday when I was doing feedback and I was like, I know, you guys 
mentioned like a few concerns with them. But I was like, I was like, 
this is awesome. Pretty good, you know. And so yeah, that's awesome, 
glad to hear that those are doing well.
23
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.719
stefanbaciu: Yeah, thanks for the feedback. I'm gonna take it and then 
try to make it even better. So.
24
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.872
Copy Accelerator: Sweet. Yeah, that's a lot. So much of so much of 
marketing is just
25
00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.490
Copy Accelerator: iteration. You know what I mean. It's it's less 
about like
26
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.779
Copy Accelerator: the 1st version of anything, and it's more about 
testing and headlines and optimizing, and all that kind of stuff so 
cool.
27
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.290
Copy Accelerator: Who else has got a a win you want to share.
28
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.800
Copy Accelerator: Don't be shy if you have one.
29
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:11.959
Jay Topp: I've yeah, I I've got a I've had some wins on some landing 
pages. Just like beating, beating the controls on some old landing 
right?
30
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.586
Jay Topp: That wrote a while ago. But yeah, I'll I'll got questions 
around that as well. But I'll I'll say them for later. But yeah.

31
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.539
Copy Accelerator: Cool. Well, hey? The fact that they're you're 
getting some wins on that is good, though. And yeah, later on the 
call. I'm happy to answer some questions there for sure.
32
00:03:27.255 --> 00:03:29.040
Copy Accelerator: Sweet anybody else.
33
00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.869
Copy Accelerator: But some days, you know, some days we get lots of 
wind. Some days people are more shy.
34
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.721
Thea Lawson: Both of my emails from last week did exceptionally well, 
I don't have actual metrics yet, but
35
00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:43.509
Thea Lawson: it's always nice to hear.
36
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.440
Copy Accelerator: That is always nice to hear. It's always nice to 
hear your voice. See, I'm really glad glad to hear that.
37
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.900
Thea Lawson: Oh, Stephanie, you too.
38
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.233
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, always I'm happy, or to be on the call. I'm 
like, I'm oh, like I'm excited that you're on it. So.
39
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.510
Thea Lawson: Yeah, no, it makes me so happy like, oh, we've got our 10 
Am. Before you again.
40
00:03:58.116 --> 00:04:02.160
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, absolutely. And that's great, really good job 
of Demos. That's awesome.
41

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:03.420
Thea Lawson: Thank you. Bye.
42
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.610
Copy Accelerator: Yes, yes.
43
00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.545
Copy Accelerator: sweet.
44
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:16.570
Copy Accelerator: cool. Yeah, to my end, I guess, is an update. If you 
were always curious, you know, the peptide stuff is continued to do. 
Well, I think we had our best day ever yesterday. So that was good. 
We've been onboarding
45
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:22.770
Copy Accelerator: email list managers, cause also. That's a huge 
initiative for us is like the fact that our
46
00:04:23.332 --> 00:04:35.697
Copy Accelerator: lists are still. Our deliverability is kind of 
messed up or migraine and Marrow Post. And there's a lot of steps. And 
I have to say, email in general used to be so much easier now with 
like deliverability stuff. There's it's just so much more technical. I 
feel like then.
47
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:45.070
Copy Accelerator: you know, when I my 1st list of Hoyland health back 
in the day it was like we had ashap port stuff went in, sent out 
emails. Everything inbox was great. And now it's like there's just so 
much
48
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.130
Copy Accelerator: more stuff to do. But that's
49
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.310
Copy Accelerator: it's so cool, I mean, and we hired a full time. Cro 
team that's give gave us like a whole roadmap of testing things and
50
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.219
Copy Accelerator: ideas. They're gonna be implementing to increase 

conversion rate. And so I don't know. I'm excited about all of that. 
And
51
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.447
Copy Accelerator: so things are. Things are pretty good on my end, 
too, but
52
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.760
Copy Accelerator: sweet, there's no other wins. We'll jump in, and we 
got one last chance, and we got a 1. Do you want to share before we 
jump in?
53
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.680
Mony Zarazua: I don't have a win but I saw that you posted about 
getting testimonials
54
00:05:14.182 --> 00:05:19.689
Mony Zarazua: and I just wanted to share like what we've been doing. 
And we've got so many video testimonials from our customers.
55
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:20.720
Copy Accelerator: Really.
56
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.720
Mony Zarazua: Yeah, so.
57
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.560
Copy Accelerator: Did you? Did you? Yeah, go ahead, please share.
58
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.119
Mony Zarazua: Yeah, you guys have like a Facebook group where you get 
engagement or not really.
59
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:38.010
Copy Accelerator: That we don't. But we're hiring for a Facebook sort 
of community manager, and that's on our immediate like sort of next 
month. Plan to get one for for that reason. So is that that's a good 
1st step.
60
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:55.829

Mony Zarazua: Absolutely. So what we usually do we make posts saying 
something like, share your progress pictures, or a video or something 
in the best testimonial is gonna win something. And that way we get a 
lot of them. And then also we do challenges every one or 2 months.
61
00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:18.469
Mony Zarazua: So any like sort of little challenge that you can do 
that that involves your product and be like I don't know I don't. I 
wouldn't know exactly what kind of challenge. But then part of the 
thing that they have to do to win is enter like a video explaining or 
giving a testimonial pretty much, and we don't ever give them scripts, 
because when we did, they sounded very fake.
62
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:29.200
Mony Zarazua: So what we just do is give them guidelines like. For 
example, you can share. I don't know how much break you lost. And how 
do you feel after these? How were you feeling before?
63
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:37.249
Mony Zarazua: And then we've got like 100, probably testimonials, 
video testimonial. They're really good just doing that. So it's just 
like a lot of engagement. Yeah.
64
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.479
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, that's awesome. Thank you for sharing that.
65
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:52.400
Mony Zarazua: Yeah, and never incentives either like discounts or 
stuff like that. We just go it. This works specifically with women, 
just being like, if you share your story, you're gonna help more 
women. And that's really helped us, too. So.
66
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:59.811
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, that's that is helpful. I wrote up an email 
cause we thought about emailing some of our customers who've been 
using the medications for 3 or 4 months and
67
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:08.240
Copy Accelerator: I had a line like that, and I kind of removed it 
because I was like, well, I don't know if that matters that much. But 
so, hearing that from you now, I'm sorry I'm gonna add that line back 
in.

68
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.379
Mony Zarazua: Yeah, yeah, it really does help us. So.
69
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.580
Copy Accelerator: Okay, amazing. Thank you.
70
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:17.118
Copy Accelerator: Awesome. Alright. Cool. Well, let's jump in
71
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.810
Copy Accelerator: So I'll go and share my screen here.
72
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:28.730
Copy Accelerator: like I said, today, we're gonna be talking about 
background story and the Ump as a quick kind of refresher reminder, I 
shared like the really simple.
73
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:36.529
Copy Accelerator: you know, structural component of a video sales 
letter. You know each of these last few calls. So from sort of a hook, 
a lead background story
74
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:43.059
Copy Accelerator: discovery story. Which is kind of part of the 
background in a way. The unique mechanism of promise solution.
75
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.370
Copy Accelerator: product buildup and reveal close and faqs one sec.
76
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.630
Copy Accelerator: we've gone through
77
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.229
Copy Accelerator: the lead. And
78
00:07:54.644 --> 00:08:02.945
Copy Accelerator: you know this overall structure and leads. We'll 
come back to sort of a little bit about hooks and micro leads, too. 
But we'll probably have a whole section or session on that in the near 

future.
79
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:11.259
Copy Accelerator: we also talked a bit about different formats, like, 
you know, short little ones, which we're gonna also do a whole section 
on our whole. I keep saying section session
80
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:18.050
Copy Accelerator: medium length ones, and then like longer ones, look 
at that skin testing from Beverly Hills, Md. For the longer one.
81
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.229
Copy Accelerator: And then we've also looked at the kind of more in-
depth outline
82
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.960
Copy Accelerator: with a pre-liter microlead or a hook.
83
00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:31.990
Copy Accelerator: The lead itself. Background story, unique mechanism 
of the problem solution product, open, reveal and close. And so
84
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:33.849
Copy Accelerator: Taylor, be focusing on
85
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:44.050
Copy Accelerator: the background story and the unique mechanism of the 
problem. I'm gonna switch to this document, which is basically has 
these parts isolated. I have all this in Google Drive, which I will, 
of course, be sharing.
86
00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.689
Copy Accelerator: I'm dropped my headset.
87
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.629
Copy Accelerator: I guess I play any audio over going here.
88
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:56.110
Copy Accelerator: and so let me kind of quickly walk through what 
these components have, and then we'll look at some specific examples.

89
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.690
Copy Accelerator: So the background story of a sales letters is after 
the lead.
90
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.349
Copy Accelerator: That's kind of like, you know. Who am I? Who's the 
Spokesperson
91
00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.030
Copy Accelerator: credibility builders?
92
00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.390
Copy Accelerator: Typically.
93
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:12.239
Copy Accelerator: I'm looking at where this isn't the case, you know a 
quick story about me, or someone close to me was just like you.
94
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.250
Copy Accelerator: They were in pain. Here's the emotional story about 
it.
95
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.479
Copy Accelerator: Often traditional solutions, advice were not 
working.
96
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:29.409
Copy Accelerator: and there's a trigger event, a pain point, some a 
place where the pain point escalates, where the avatar realizes 
something must change, and by avatar I mean spokesperson again as 
well, basically like.
97
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:49.149
Copy Accelerator: you know, if it was the actual, you'll you'll see 
examples in a second. But basically, if it was a a doctor who has a 
patient and the patients and so much pain. They're like, we gotta 
figure this out. Traditional solutions aren't working. Or and I got, 
you know more traditional story where it's spokesperson, and you'll 
see some of the biz OP. One where it's basically it's like, you know.

98
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:56.469
Copy Accelerator: they are trying to make money and and nothing's 
working like. All right, something's gotta change here, and they'll 
kind of look for
99
00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:00.540
Copy Accelerator: truth and answers, or start digging in and trying to 
find something
100
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.240
Copy Accelerator: that you know is is a solution.
101
00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:08.139
Copy Accelerator: or that can help them solve their their pain point 
and problem. And so once they do that.
102
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:11.349
Copy Accelerator: you know. Usually you'll go into the unique 
mechanism of the problem.
103
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:13.460
Copy Accelerator: So the real cause of the problem.
104
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.379
Copy Accelerator: it's usually surprising. It's backed by credibility, 
improved.
105
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:25.830
Copy Accelerator: And as we talked about mechanisms previously. The 
solution is like, Okay, now you know the problem. This is a real 
solution. We often present it on a macro level which we'll talk about 
shortly.
106
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.890
Copy Accelerator: It's connected to the problem.
107
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.679
Copy Accelerator: And then they have to dig deep. To kind of see. 
Okay, well.

108
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.060
Copy Accelerator: proving the solution really works. There is a 
solution.
109
00:10:35.794 --> 00:10:41.690
Copy Accelerator: So we're gonna go through background stories. 1st 
and look at these examples, and then we'll also look at
110
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:57.190
Copy Accelerator: the Ump, and I think I'm gonna show you guys a 
couple of things of the umps around like a few other interesting 
points I haven't always talked about, but that are, I think, valuable 
to see. So the 1st one we'll look at is that newer one that we looked 
at the 2 sessions ago. I believe it was
111
00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.180
Copy Accelerator: so. I'm pulling this up here. I will make it bigger
112
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.449
Copy Accelerator: in a moment, so you can see it, and we'll have this 
up in the outline up side by side.
113
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:06.460
Copy Accelerator: So we've got this here.
114
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.089
Copy Accelerator: We've got this
115
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.610
Copy Accelerator: here at a hundred 50.
116
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:21.129
Copy Accelerator: So the newer Vsl for those of you guys. It's in the 
1st week again. So 2 weeks ago June.
117
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:26.050
Copy Accelerator: I won't say 5, th but wouldn't be the 5.th It would 
have been the 11th June 11.th
118

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.679
Copy Accelerator: you'll see a credibility component.
119
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.069
Copy Accelerator: But what you will see is that on this Vsl. Which is 
a medium length thing, the total Vsl. Is about 16 min long.
120
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:43.139
Copy Accelerator: It kind of goes through this part very quickly and 
gets in the mechanism, and that is something you'll see on sort of 
more branded type of stuff
121
00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.899
Copy Accelerator: running as an imped ad at a medium length on 
Facebook.
122
00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:47.990
Copy Accelerator: So
123
00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:56.820
Copy Accelerator: let's look at it with new right? So the lead of this 
one we looked at was a say goodbye to enema on your legs, Tristan. 8. 
See what happens. Here are 3 early signs of edema.
124
00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.930
Copy Accelerator: so, or edema. So if we go back to our kind of broad 
outline.
125
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:03.540
Copy Accelerator: yeah, what you're seeing there is like that will 
hook a microlead.
126
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:16.639
Copy Accelerator: And then they're going to like the actual kind of 
like, like, I guess all this is sort of like like the the signs. Then 
it goes into like the rest of the actual lead. I'm not going to repeat 
this because I already went over previously. But that's sort of an 
example of where the hooks coming right away.
127
00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.609
Copy Accelerator: Okay, now.

128
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.529
Copy Accelerator: this one is a short, because again, these are 
shorter format.
129
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.040
Copy Accelerator: Really, it's like a hook.
130
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:32.450
Copy Accelerator: a quick little lead here for this one, and it's 
going to that background story. Right? So we said before, who am I? 
Credibility builder? Whatever it is, right in this case.
131
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:41.360
Copy Accelerator: Hi, my name is Dr. Jeremy Campbell. I'm a doctor of 
physical therapy from Chicago. I have over 10 years of clinical 
experience and clocked in over well over 10,000 h.
132
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:45.809
Copy Accelerator: Throughout my career. I've helped over 1,100 
patients, overcome all kinds of foot problems
133
00:12:46.185 --> 00:13:13.520
Copy Accelerator: lymphedema, edema, neuropathy, plantar fasciitis. 
You name it. I've seen it all anything, from mild stiffness and 
swelling to people struggling with varicose spider veins to edema so 
bad that you can barely recognize that body part you're looking at. 
But it wasn't until earlier this year that I truly cracked the cock, 
the code to provide relief from edema. It all started with one 
breakthrough discovery I had. If you're struggling with swollen legs, 
feet, or ankles, you may have something called venous insufficiency 
condition where the veins in your calves fail to send the oxygen star 
back up to your heart.
134
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:30.240
Copy Accelerator: This was also blood point around the area of your 
calves, feet, and ankles, which ultimately causes falling stiffness 
and soreness. It can happen when you sit at your desk for too many 
hours every day, but it can also happen when you stand for too long as 
well, your skin may feel like it's overstretched and about to burst 
any second, making every step heavier than the last, like your legs 
are stuck in bud.

135
00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:48.400
Copy Accelerator: But you're not alone. Recent research shows that 
over 25 million individuals in the Us. Alone struggle, advanced 
insufficiency, and the number increases every year. Advance 
insufficiency is only half the answer. Here's a 1, in fact, that very 
few people know about. But everyone should know about their edema. 
What if I told you that the edema installing your feet and legs are 
actually caused by your caps.
136
00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:49.490
Copy Accelerator: So
137
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.860
Copy Accelerator: if you look at this one here for that background 
story, you might think, okay, is it getting to the mechanism
138
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:56.579
Copy Accelerator: when I started talking about the Venus insufficiency 
thing?
139
00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:05.300
Copy Accelerator: But I think, knowing the market expert on this 
market, they probably already know about being this insufficiency. And 
so I think he's sort of giving you a little bit of a background of 
like.
140
00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.250
Copy Accelerator: you know, this is how you know, you're struggling 
with this.
141
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:15.250
Copy Accelerator: he doesn't really have like in this. And this one's 
very fast. It's sort of like.
142
00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:21.759
Copy Accelerator: you know. I'm a doctor. Lots of people are suffering 
from this pain point. There's no emotional story really about it.
143
00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:25.509
Copy Accelerator: And then sort of saying, like, you know.

144
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.587
Copy Accelerator: you're not alone.
145
00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:32.359
Copy Accelerator: but it's only half the answer. And here's where I 
would say it really gets into, like the mechanism of the problem.
146
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:48.599
Copy Accelerator: So let's talk about like what happens right? The 
real cause you've heard in this case. Usually, I say, you've had 99% 
of the answer. But you're missing one. And this one is sort of saying 
you had half the answer, but you're missing the other 50. But the 
other 50 is really like one thing still right? So that's why I would 
kind of count. This is where the mechanism of the problem starts.
147
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.159
Copy Accelerator: So again, what if I told you that edema and swine 
your feet and legs are actually caused by your caps.
148
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:59.049
Copy Accelerator: That's right. Your feet might be perfectly fine. 
Your calves are the problem. Let me explain this further.
149
00:14:59.430 --> 00:15:25.250
Copy Accelerator: Do you know that we doctors refer to calves as a 
second heart? That's because they play a crucial role in your body's 
blood circulation? You see a real heart, since blood all over your 
body, including your feet, gain the blood. To go down to our feet is 
easy. It's like signing down a side, but gain it back up. It's like 
climbing back up the side. Your heart can't pull all the blood back up 
by itself. That's where the calves help with this big job. When your 
calf muscles contract, they compress their veins and your leg the 
veins and your legs, and push blood from your feet back up towards 
your heart.
150
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:31.920
Copy Accelerator: That's why we call the calves the second heart. They 
single handly maintain normal blood circulation in your body. And 
here's the problem that I don't see what talking about.
151
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:58.410
Copy Accelerator: As you sit for long hours every day, continue to 

age, become less physically active. Your calves get weaker as they get 
weaker. They don't contract the way they used to, so the vein valves 
in your calves they're responsible for for pushing the blood back up 
to your heart tend to weaken as well. This causes the veins. 
Insufficiency. I mentioned earlier. When that happens, your calves can 
no longer send all the old, still blood from your lower body back to 
your heart. So some of the stay stuck in your feet and legs. Now this 
buildup of old still blood can cause swelling in your feet and ankles. 
They can also lead to more serious foot conditions if left untreated.
152
00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:22.070
Copy Accelerator: Starting to see how it all fits together. Weak. 
Cause your vein valves to weaken, or we cast cause your vein vows to 
weaken those weekend vein valves fail to send the old deoxygenated 
blood back up to your heart which ultimately causes the blood to pull 
around your casfe and ankles, making your legs swollen and puffy, and 
feeling like they're stuck in mud. Most people don't even notice they 
have early symptoms, but actually lean cause why people over 35 
struggle stiff and swollen legs, and having this described as having 
legs stuck in concrete.
153
00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:51.419
Copy Accelerator: Well, most of the Wannabe solutions are trying to 
relieve swine by focusing on the feet. They totally miss the fact that 
it's weak calves that are hidden the hidden culprit. That's also why 
popular remedies like compression socks, soft ass and different pills, 
can't solve the problem. They don't focus on stimulating your calves 
at all, and vein valves inside of them. So if you want to get relief 
from edema edema in your feet and legs, and if you want to reduce the 
swine stiffness and aches. You need to stimulate your calves, and the 
vein valves in your calves to reduce the pooled blood in your calves, 
ankles and feet. So this is where the s kind of comes in right to sort 
of explain.
154
00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:57.769
Copy Accelerator: like, here's the real problem. Now, I know we didn't 
get to like the credibility and performance on this one.
155
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:04.660
Copy Accelerator: but sort of like he's a doctor, which, by the way, 
is why doctors are easy, because you can kind of like using a doctor. 
The value of using a doctor spokesperson for helping is like.
156
00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.229
Copy Accelerator: or any any credible person you kind of be like.

157
00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:09.650
Copy Accelerator: you know. Obviously, I know this, I'm a doctor.
158
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:14.340
Copy Accelerator: but like, it's pretty like. So it's basically from
159
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:15.599
Copy Accelerator: here
160
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:21.749
Copy Accelerator: to here. Now, here's what I want to show you guys 
really quickly, and then we'll look at. I'll come back to the ums, and 
we'll look at a few other examples.
161
00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.520
Copy Accelerator: If you kind of. Look at the way
162
00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:29.229
Copy Accelerator: the Ump structure works for a lot of stuff, 
especially in health. Other examples outside of it.
163
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:34.679
Copy Accelerator: It's really like the the method of like, hey, here's 
how this system or process or thing is supposed to work.
164
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.769
Copy Accelerator: This is why that system isn't working like it's 
supposed to.
165
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:40.929
Copy Accelerator: That's kind of the heart of the Ump.
166
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:47.400
Copy Accelerator: and then often they'll be like. That's why you know 
what external factors or culprits could be causing the malfunction. 
Why is it happening to you.
167
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:51.249

Copy Accelerator: So if we look at this, it really follows that 
example where it's like.
168
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:53.183
Copy Accelerator: you know.
169
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:03.559
Copy Accelerator: you know, your your calves do this. They're supposed 
to basically pump blood back up from heart, sends blood down. Your 
calves are supposed to send blood back up.
170
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:06.889
Copy Accelerator: That's how it's supposed to work right. But
171
00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:28.940
Copy Accelerator: here's the problem. When you step for a long time or 
become old or have less physical activity, your cows get weaker when 
they get weaker, they can't contract, and they can't send blood back 
up so sort of like what external factors are causing this malfunction. 
Well, it's just like get getting older staying for long hours every 
day, continue to age, being less physically active. Right? These 
things make this problem. They answer it here, and not like after they 
do this. But when this happens.
172
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:37.010
Copy Accelerator: this is why the system can't work right. I want to 
show you another example of that with another health one. And then 
we're going to switch to a Biz OP. One from there.
173
00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.139
Copy Accelerator: So let me show you guys
174
00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:43.679
Copy Accelerator: that example of that Beverly Hills, Md. Pinch test 
one that we looked at previously.
175
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:46.570
Copy Accelerator: Okay, I'll make this nice and big, too.
176
00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:51.588
Copy Accelerator: So this is like I basically took. And by the way, I 

want to show you guys this as well. I think it was in this one right?
177
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:57.710
Copy Accelerator: So as I mentioned that they do this, and I was like 
I should do it as well. You can take like a transcript
178
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:16.180
Copy Accelerator: quad right and go like, is it? Someone's transcripts 
to flick on Youtube, for example, we try to start saying from Youtube, 
it's got Timestamps to cuts off. It's sort of annoying. So you can 
literally just go. I did twice here. Here's a transcript of video 
sales letter for skincare brand. That's gonna take it clean it up. So 
it's more readable about timestamps or awkward line breaks. Can you do 
that
179
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:20.279
Copy Accelerator: now, I impo, I'll I'll be honest. One dumb thing is 
like, I'm like, if you need more
180
00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:27.570
Copy Accelerator: to do multiple outputs. Just ask me to continue. 
When you're out of space I'll keep doing it. But I had this, which is 
sort of like a pain in the ass to try to read and teach off of.
181
00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:38.560
Copy Accelerator: and so it it did. It cleaned it up. The one annoying 
thing is that like it did cut off because it has a window. The amount 
of like, you know. Text. It can do as an output, I said. Continue. And 
then, in Po, least, it was like, Oh, I don't have any context.
182
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:59.210
Copy Accelerator: And I'm like, Do this section. And then it sort of 
just like gave me a summary. And I'm like, What are you doing? So then 
I basically started a new chat and did the part that it where hadn't 
formatted, which is like the rest of that section I had previously, 
and then it did it for me. It might be that you use actual Claude. It 
would have the contacts. You don't have to do that annoying thing. But 
it is actually really helpful, right? Because now I have it
183
00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.040
Copy Accelerator: nicely formatted and don't have to like try to like
184

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.810
Copy Accelerator: figure out anything else. So it's just a little time 
saver pack right?
185
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:18.069
Copy Accelerator: But in this one, right? This is Beverly Hills, Md. 
One. This is after like the there's a pinch testing about your skin. 
There's a lead and then gets it in, gets into the the background 
story. So if I go back to
186
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:19.290
Copy Accelerator: like.
187
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:25.450
Copy Accelerator: you know background story. This one's gonna follow 
this a bit more more directly this classic
188
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:28.619
Copy Accelerator: model on the background story. Okay, so let's let's 
read it real quick.
189
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:38.630
Copy Accelerator: Let me briefly introduce myself again. My name is 
Dr. John Lakey. Many people will recognize me as a co-founder of the 
world, renowned Beverly Hills, Plastic Surgery group for my partner, 
Dr. Pam and Daniel.
190
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:51.240
Copy Accelerator: And this is a transcript. I'm not sure what to say, 
and I have been treating some of today's biggest stars for over a 
decade or for my appearances on TV shows, such as the doctors and 
entertainer tonight, I'm often interviewed about the latest corrective 
procedures.
191
00:20:51.240 --> 00:21:13.129
Copy Accelerator: But even though I'm best known for my work as a 
plastic surgeon, have also dedicated a large portion of my career to 
searching for ways to define the signs of aging valines or needles. In 
fact, my research in the field of Youth restoration has been published 
in lean medical journals all around the world. However, the simple 
technique I'm going to show you today has never been revealed prior to 
this report, because once I discovered it, I knew I had to share it 
with public directly, so I couldn't be more excited for the 

transformation you're about to experience.
192
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.420
Copy Accelerator: But 1st let's get back to our super agents.
193
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.360
Copy Accelerator: Alright. You see, I 1st started looking into this 
phenomenon after a chance encounter with 2 very unusual women in my 
clinic.
194
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:40.759
Copy Accelerator: Well, it wasn't exactly by chance. The 1st one. 
Let's call her. Linda had scheduled a consultation with me several 
weeks prior to discuss some possible treatments for sagging skin and 
wrinkles, so I already knew she'd be coming in. What I wasn't 
expecting, however, was for her to arrive with her grown daughter in 
tow. At least that's why I merely assumed the woman with Linda to be 
oh, shoot me like these people, and who are in the waiting room one 
second
195
00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:54.809
Copy Accelerator: But when she finally introduced us I was speechless. 
Oh, this is my sister Joanne, she said casually. Now, now she's busy 
in town this week, so I figured I bring her along. She's always wanted 
to see what a plastic surgery clinic looks like.
196
00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:24.449
Copy Accelerator: Wait, wait, wait! I thought this was lost process. 
Joanne looked about 20 years younger than Linda, so either there was a 
significant age difference between the 2, or Joanne had definitely 
spent her fair share of time in a plastic surgeon's office before, and 
was just trying to convince her sister otherwise, at any rate, I guess 
it wasn't able to hide my confusion very well, because Linda's smile 
and me instantly disappeared. You thought she was my daughter, didn't 
you? I could feel my face turning red. It's okay, everyone does, she 
sighed. That's why I'm here, Dr. Leakey. Joanna's only 2 years younger 
than me. Well, I keep getting older, more wrinkled. She looks like 
she's she looks like she's 30. What am I doing wrong?
197
00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:35.129
Copy Accelerator: So pause here for a quick second. Right? We had all 
this credibility about this doctor. Right? He's on entertainment 
tonight. He's on the doctors. He's Beverly Hills plastic surgeon. He's 
published, you know.

198
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:40.240
Copy Accelerator: like multiple things in leading medical journals 
right? And then this is got a very classic story about
199
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.800
Copy Accelerator: you. Have someone.
200
00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:51.670
Copy Accelerator: someone like I knew someone close to me was just 
like you there in pain. Here's a sort of emotional story in this case. 
The fact that he thought that her sister was her daughter.
201
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:59.740
Copy Accelerator: Right? So now let's see about traditional solutions 
and advice not working. If there's a trigger event, search for truth. 
Okay, so
202
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:00.869
Copy Accelerator: back to here
203
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:27.310
Copy Accelerator: I could tell this was a real point of frustration 
for Linda, and I truly felt for her. After all, senior skin age wasn't 
bad enough. Her sister's youthful appearance only added insult to 
injury. But here's the thing at 63. Linda didn't actually look old for 
her age, for her age. Sure, she had notable wrinkles around her eyes 
and mouth, and the skin on her cheeks, neck, and jaw lines were 
starting to say considerably. These problems were extremely common 
among women. Her age, in fact, most people would consider them normal. 
So far as I could tell, Linda wasn't doing anything wrong. The real 
question was, What was Joanna doing differently
204
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:45.729
Copy Accelerator: now? If the 2 weren't directly related, I would have 
probably just checked it chalked up to Jeanette's. But since there 
were sisters. That couldn't be the case, so I probably asked her, Anne 
if she was sure she never had any work done, even if it was just a 
round of dermal fillers or laser treatments at a petition's office, 
but she swore she had it. I live in a small town, Dr. Licky. We even 
have places to offer that sort of thing she left.
205

00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:58.860
Copy Accelerator: so I decided to ask some preliminary questions about 
their lifestyles, just to see if their routines differed in any way, 
but I learned only more puzzled. Both Joanne and Linda had never 
smoked. They rarely drink alcohol. They both had relatively healthy 
diets, and while they both admitted to tanning their teens and 
twenties.
206
00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:16.429
Copy Accelerator: There's no reason why some damage would have 
affected one more than the other. Moreover, they both had 2 children 
and similarly demanding jobs. So even their street level stress levels 
couldn't have been that different. Yeah. Linda skin was starting to 
sag crease and look wilted, while Joanna's or Joanne skin looked taut 
and lifted as ever, barely a wrinkle in sight. They made no sense
207
00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:31.780
Copy Accelerator: so as a last resort, I asked Joanne to walk me 
through her entire daily routine. Step by step, from the time she woke 
up to time she went to bed, and finally I have my answer turns out 
there are actually 3 things Duran did every day that work together to 
keep her appearance from aging. The funny thing is, she didn't even 
know that what they were until I pointed them out to her.
208
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:41.809
Copy Accelerator: And then we're gonna get into the mechanism here. So 
let's start. Joanne's 1st super agile habit. Well, actually, let me 
back up just a bit, because, in order to fully explain the 
significance of it well, I'll 1st need to tell you about something 
called Dht.
209
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.799
Copy Accelerator: so I should be clear about to move into the 
mechanism right with DHT.
210
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.000
Copy Accelerator: So
211
00:24:46.340 --> 00:25:02.660
Copy Accelerator: you know, kind of like in this case like it's sort 
of like what you know, what traditional things. Well, they, you know 
they're not drinking. They're not smoking. They're not sort of doing 
anything dramatic like, you know, they're not doing anything wrong, 
like they're not the traditional advice about what causes skin issues 

wouldn't make sense for the one woman. But that's for the other woman.
212
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:19.600
Copy Accelerator: And in this case that trigger event is really a 
simple like confusion about why would it be that this woman is having 
such like, you know her sister has such great skin, no sense wrinkles, 
while the other woman windows skin, you know, looks all saggy and old, 
like right. He kind of wants to know the truth. She starts asking all 
these questions.
213
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:28.470
Copy Accelerator: Now we get to the mechanism. And what's interesting 
about the mechanism of what's why I just said before, this one follows 
very closely this idea of like how a system is supposed to work.
214
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:34.330
Copy Accelerator: why, it isn't working, and then I think it also 
talks about external factors and culprits. So let me show you what I 
mean by that.
215
00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:45.249
Copy Accelerator: Okay, Dhc is hardly a new discovery. It's a hormone 
that all human bodies naturally produce. So scientists have known 
about it for decades, but for a long time its effect on woman was 
large, largely ignored. And I'll tell you why.
216
00:25:45.370 --> 00:26:05.300
Copy Accelerator: You see, even though virtually everyone's body 
starts to produce more and more Dhc as they get older, this process 
was initially linked to baldness and men. So since hair loss solutions 
are a huge moneymaker funding for Dhc research is primarily centered 
around studies on male pattern baldness ever since. The truth is, Dhc 
also plays a major role in how women look to the more differences in 
women, its effects are more visible on their skin.
217
00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:16.850
Copy Accelerator: Now it's not to say it can't cost any hair in woman 
as well. It certainly can, but the biggest signs of increased Dht are 
actually loose. Sagging skin wrinkles and loss of elasticity. Why? 
Because the ht inhibits your body's production of collagen.
218
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:37.009
Copy Accelerator: you see, collagen is the protein that keeps your 

skin firm, taut and lifted. In fact, I like to think of it as your 
skin's primary support system, because without it your skin would 
literally be unable to hold itself up. Now, your body's ability to 
produce collagen naturally slows down in the years before, during and 
after menopause. So if you talk about what's the sort of external 
culprit or thing, or you know, besides causing this issue menopause
219
00:26:37.060 --> 00:27:01.517
Copy Accelerator: but one for Dhc, the effects will be nearly as 
obvious, because, just as your college and production starts to 
decline your production of college and blocking Dhc. Simultaneously 
increases, making even harder for you to fight your skin, to fight 
gravity and maintain its youthful firmness. So if you're seeing saggy 
skin on your cheeks, neck, chin, and gel line, or loose wobbling skin 
under upper arms, dht is likely to blame. This is like a little quick 
summary of what he just shared. And I want to actually point that out, 
because if we go back to the new new grow thing here.
220
00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:03.300
Copy Accelerator: like
221
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.660
Copy Accelerator: kind of same thing here. Right? It was sort of like.
222
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:08.990
Copy Accelerator: this is a yeah, I guess. Ums. But he had it. Where 
was it here?
223
00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:28.510
Copy Accelerator: Starting to see us office together like weak calves? 
Do this cause your cause main valves to weaken. We can vein valves. 
Don't send blood back up. Takes blood pool, leaves your legs to own a 
puffy right? And here is sort of like a quick like, hey, if you're 
doing doing these things? Dhc is to blame.
224
00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.645
Copy Accelerator: Right?
225
00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:55.940
Copy Accelerator: and this is okay. So this point you're probably 
wondering, okay, but what does this have to do? If Joanne's the other 
routine. Well, here's the scoop, even though Joanne wasn't big on 
skincare makeup for the past few years she's been taking a natural 

herb across soft metal to help thicken her hair. Now we start to get 
into the ums. Now they do their ums while interlacing the ingredients 
into it, because it's a skin a skincare supplement. Actually. So we'll 
come back to this in a second. I'll make a note of it start of
226
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:06.880
Copy Accelerator: okay. But like we look at the format again like this 
isn't called Dht. Everybody's got it. And men and women. The problem 
is that in women, especially as you know you get through menopause.
227
00:28:07.663 --> 00:28:09.210
Copy Accelerator: Dhc, like
228
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:28.409
Copy Accelerator: is you produce a lot more of it, and it causes your 
skin. It destroys, collagen, and causes your skin to sag, what's the 
solution gonna be? Well, you wanna kind of stop the overproduction of 
Dht, and then figure out how to lift and firm your skin so that it 
isn't sagging right like. But the one thing to note with both these 
unique mechanisms is that
229
00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.269
Copy Accelerator: even though the newer one's short and that one's 
longer like.
230
00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:39.320
Copy Accelerator: There's not like a bunch of studies in it, and we're 
gonna biz up next. But there's not much of studies in it where it's 
like,
231
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:51.249
Copy Accelerator: you know, in fact, like a study from Harvard found 
that in 33% of women blah, blah blah. And then 22, like, yeah, I used 
to do that a lot, and I still think a study or 2 can be good. But I 
think one thing that gets sort of
232
00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.900
Copy Accelerator: people do health especially kind of
233
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.020
Copy Accelerator: it's good to have proof elements. But

234
00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:06.390
Copy Accelerator: it doesn't mean like, you need to just rattle off a 
bunch of journals and studies that have found things. I don't know 
that people care that much, especially when it's coming from a expert 
right? Which is in both of these things.
235
00:29:06.837 --> 00:29:12.529
Copy Accelerator: I see here. Can you share? So yeah, I will. I shared 
is is I shared the the full transcript? In the
236
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:22.669
Copy Accelerator: with the call from 6 11. I'm sure all the all the 
documents. This whole Google drive will get shared as documents. With 
everybody when we put up the replay. But
237
00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:29.629
Copy Accelerator: here's the document, too, and Chelsea 55,000 people 
pop in here now. But that's okay. That's the doc. Okay? So
238
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:34.689
Copy Accelerator: now I wanna look at biz off, because I've done a lot 
of health stuff, you know, lately. So
239
00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.639
Copy Accelerator: let me go pull up like this biz OP version.
240
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.421
Copy Accelerator: I mean, can you.
241
00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:50.339
Copy Accelerator: Can you clarify that for me? I'm trying to remember. 
Was it? Was it in the Ump, specifically, or was it with the 
ingredients.
242
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.010
Armin Farah: That was in the that was in the ingredients. I didn't 
know you were referencing.
243
00:29:54.377 --> 00:29:56.350
Copy Accelerator: Referencing that in the unique mechanism when you're 

saying like.
244
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.980
Armin Farah: Specifically.
245
00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:13.940
Copy Accelerator: Say, for example, it's really collagen. It's like 
you don't need like again. I I don't. I don't think would be bad, for, 
like fact, like Harvard did a big study, and they found that collagen 
decreases by 75, or like you, whatever like, or that Dhc increase. I 
don't I? It's not that you can't have a study or 2 in that part. It 
says, sometimes I see people that are sort of like
246
00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.640
Copy Accelerator: giving like study after study after study after 
study, all trying to prove that, like collagen.
247
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:34.939
Copy Accelerator: you know, or the Dhc is a problem. And it's like, 
generally, if you have, like a doctor and expert, and you maybe 
reference a study or 2. You're good. And I think that extends the 
unique mechanism of the problem part like kind of too long, but with 
ingredients. I do think like sharing some studies is important. And 
again, if they have specific, like
248
00:30:35.326 --> 00:30:42.040
Copy Accelerator: stats around them, like they saw a 17 decrease in 
wrinkles. Right? That that's the thing I think I was talking about 
with you, and I think that's very important.
249
00:30:42.370 --> 00:30:44.380
Armin Farah: Okay, thank you for clarifying.
250
00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.849
Copy Accelerator: Yes, thanks for asking.
251
00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.789
Copy Accelerator: Okay, so this one is the one that if you look at 
everyone's use the auto vsl thing we created
252
00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.850

Copy Accelerator: or just sort of like seen this. This is like a swipe 
for a high ticket.
253
00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.829
Copy Accelerator: Offer if I could book a call funnel. Okay?
254
00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:00.180
Copy Accelerator: And
255
00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:13.070
Copy Accelerator: I'll talk real quick about the hook. Right? You see 
this ordinary spatial up on my screen. It's probably just like the 
spatial you bought off Amazoncom recently. The second you finished 
your order on Amazon for that bad boy. You put $7 in Sean's pocket. 
Who's Shawn? This is Shawn
256
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:24.190
Copy Accelerator: right? He sells proxy, Amazon specific kitchen 
utensils just like the spatula. Shawn doesn't commute to work every 
day. He doesn't have to clock to work, clock into work or do the 
typical 9 to 5, 8 HA day for 5 or 6 days a week.
257
00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:33.209
Copy Accelerator: He doesn't sit a cubicle or do manual labor at a job 
site. He also didn't need a college degree to sell on Amazon showers 
from someone's laptop, usually about
258
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.590
Copy Accelerator: 4 HA day.
259
00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:40.640
Copy Accelerator: Anyway, it goes on about that. But like basically 
the hook there is like, every time you buy the spatula from Amazon, 
you put $7 in Sean's pocket.
260
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.119
Copy Accelerator: Alright. And obviously, this is, gonna be a proct 
about how to sell on Amazon. Right?
261
00:31:45.220 --> 00:31:48.189
Copy Accelerator: So I'm gonna skip like the lead. It's a little bit 

different.
262
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:51.129
Copy Accelerator: The one thing I'll say for everyone doing biz OP is 
like.
263
00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.200
Copy Accelerator: if you really want like, like like
264
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:57.949
Copy Accelerator: this, this lead does have a bunch of social proof. 
Obviously, it starts with the story about Sean.
265
00:31:57.970 --> 00:32:02.429
Copy Accelerator: right? And it kind of tells you like helps. You 
understand what Shawn is making per month and per year.
266
00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.598
Copy Accelerator: and then basically, just if you look at the trait
267
00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.240
Copy Accelerator: Like in the rest of this lead, this is still. This 
is still the lead where he introduces himself. The 1st time again. I 
might go, too, in depth on this one today. We can do it later in 
another call.
268
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:18.999
Copy Accelerator: shows more sales. Shows his bank account.
269
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:22.469
Copy Accelerator: mentions other students
270
00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:33.110
Copy Accelerator: like they have my student J, my students. And all 
the thing I want to point out here is, I think, one thing that's 
missing from a lot of people is copy and ask. This counts for health, 
too, but especially in like Biz OP. Is just like a lot of
271
00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.789
Copy Accelerator: testimonials and social proof early, and I was 

actually looking at.
272
00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:54.639
Copy Accelerator: Let's see if I can find this real quick, and then 
I'll come back we did something for Rachel Rofe, who was doing the 
Amazon thing as well, and some of the script. This is her original 
control. She's doing the 8 figures of this offer? It's like another 
kind of webinar. It's missing a lot of screenshots. But I wanna what I 
want to show you guys in this thing real quick
273
00:32:54.780 --> 00:33:01.080
Copy Accelerator: is like, and we had to bring her a new version as 
well. But like, basically, Okay, here's her.
274
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:06.009
Copy Accelerator: Her nephew, like whatever right? That's like my 
Amazon sales last year.
275
00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.339
Copy Accelerator: This has been, you know, working for years. We'll 
continue to work
276
00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:18.409
Copy Accelerator: like this is more than 3 years, and we can get 
bigger. Here's my Se. Store se store brings even more money. These are 
my other stores. It's not just about
277
00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.429
Copy Accelerator: I don't. This is supposed to say here, but
278
00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.370
Copy Accelerator: I don't mess with. I mean, I think
279
00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:30.189
Copy Accelerator: this is a copy we're looking at right? Here's other 
people's success stories. These are all more testimonies. That's where 
I don't know, just because it's been a long time. Zoomages aren't 
accessible anymore.
280
00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.290
Copy Accelerator: Says a fine print. Can I do this, too?

281
00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:44.999
Copy Accelerator: And so I'm missing a bunch of slides, but I want to 
kind of fast forward a little bit, because, like, if you keep going 
right, it's like just showing more proof, passive income proof, like 
literally, the entire thing in her start is just like
282
00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:53.599
Copy Accelerator: proof. Now, obviously, you know, as far as like 
income things like you have to look at Ftc. Whatever. But that's 
something that's just missing so often, I think, especially from
283
00:33:53.710 --> 00:34:05.479
Copy Accelerator: like biz off stuff that's successful yourself like 
this is me doing it again. She has her disclaimer in this this 
presentation, right like she has this big disclaimer. But like I see a 
lot of stuff where it's sort of around biz OP type of things, or like
284
00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.510
Copy Accelerator: making money or businesses, or whatever, and like
285
00:34:08.770 --> 00:34:21.480
Copy Accelerator: people like, don't have any of starts at the very 
bottom of the page, and I'm always like I would probably move that up. 
That's 1 of the 1st things I would do right. Cause. People just wanna 
see that this actually works. And that's real. It's a different market
286
00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:28.229
Copy Accelerator: social with like help. People want to see that, too. 
But they're more to take. They're there for more of the story, 
especially like a doctor, or
287
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:49.050
Copy Accelerator: I guess the other subtlety. Hopefully, this roofing 
is is valuable, not me phone like, I'm just sort of being incoherent. 
But like, if you look at a health Bsl, okay, for example, you either 
have like a doctor where they're like, I'm a doctor. I'm super 
credible, so like you immediately can't trust me if I tell you this is 
really the problem, and this really works. There's a built in trust to 
that to some degree, or if it's more of an aggressive, like kind of
288
00:34:49.050 --> 00:35:17.840

Copy Accelerator: grey hat vs, like the clickbank universe, whatever 
it is, and it's like an everyday Joe like then, usually have such a 
create. That's where you have, like the crazier story. And you're 
mentioning Harvard a bunch of times, and like, you know, like that. 
Oh, it's might sound crazy, but it's back by Harvard and John Hopkins 
in the Mayo clinic, and like they have the crazy story that's like, 
you know, I almost lost my penis on a skiing trip like, and I'm really 
glad it happened, because it helped me to discover the curity, Ed, 
whatever right like, I'll tell you about later, and like, you know, 
but the point is like, then you're really doing super heavy on.
289
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.257
Copy Accelerator: you know, curiosity and other credible things right?
290
00:35:21.730 --> 00:35:22.860
Copy Accelerator: but like
291
00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:34.939
Copy Accelerator: so that's the nuance of of a Doctor Spokesperson 
versus like an everyday Joe spokesperson. But with biz OP almost 
always a spokesperson is is the person who's had success. But there's 
more skepticism around, like.
292
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:41.515
Copy Accelerator: you know, people have tried more. I would, I would 
honestly say, probably people have tried more things to try to make 
money
293
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:55.490
Copy Accelerator: and they're more wary of like online scams for 
business like for making money like the whole, make money online 
things very scammy. Whereas with health, I think people have a bit 
more of like an openness to like alternative health being a real thing 
that works and they probably tried. In some respects
294
00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:02.960
Copy Accelerator: they may have tried a lot of alternative health 
things, but they probably have more belief that it works. And there's 
more skepticism and less belief. If we're like at belief levels or 
something like, make money online.
295
00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:20.250
Copy Accelerator: So that's a little bit of a tangent. But I just 

think it's kind of an interesting point to to put out there. Okay, so 
let's get to the background story here. With this one, which I mark. 
Okay, so if biz OP, it's generally very similar to the same structure, 
we've talked about sorry guys. Whoops?
296
00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:35.689
Copy Accelerator: right? Well, that's sort of like, who am I? You know 
me or someone because it was in pain. Traditional solutions weren't 
working. There was this trigger event so has to change. I looked for 
search, search for truth, and answers right? So now we're on biz up, 
not health. But let's look right.
297
00:36:35.980 --> 00:37:00.900
Copy Accelerator: So 7. 1st thing you should know is, I come from very 
humble beginnings, my 2 siblings, and I shared a bedroom when we were 
younger. But my parents always make sure we had the necessities, and 
we see this to let you know that I didn't have a head start compared 
to my peers in regards to my success that I'm having right now. Fact, 
I went to less than one semester of junior college before dropping 
out. Knowing it wasn't for me. I joined the workforce at age 15, and 
after graduating high school I worked at quite a few different jobs, 
but eventually I ended up at Costco. Now Costco seemed like a great 
place to work.
298
00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:16.750
Copy Accelerator: They tell you, when you join that you'll get plenty 
of opportunities to climb up the corporate ladder they hire 
internally, you'll receive and health benefits, and eventually, if you 
stick with them long enough, you could have a management position 
making high 5 figures per year for Kid, who was just going out of high 
school. That sounded like an amazing opportunity. So every day I 
clocked in I gave them my best.
299
00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:41.210
Copy Accelerator: I have always taken pride in working my hardest, and 
being a model employee, I never called in sick. I would work any shift 
they gave me without complaining, even working late, closing shifts 
every single weekend. In fact, I was one of their fastest cashiers, 
because of that they always scheduled me on their busiest days. I 
thought, if they can see my work ethic and the responsibility as an 
employee as an employee, the next time a supervision position opens 
up, I'll be a shoe in and my salary will jump. But the longer I work 
to Costco, the more I realize that didn't matter how hard I worked.
300
00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:53.480

Copy Accelerator: the system wasn't set up to reward their best 
workers. Instead, every time a management start opened up, they would 
always pick the person who had been working there the longest, despite 
the fact that I work circles around those same people. This really 
upset me, because here I was giving it my all.
301
00:37:53.480 --> 00:38:21.139
Copy Accelerator: working harder than everyone, and clearly one of the 
top performers. But to my managers I was just another year in the 
machine. It wasn't apparent that I would. It was apparent that would 
take me years and years to get where I wanted to be, and even worse, 
it was almost completely out of my control, my breaking point. So I 
really say, trigger event right where it escalates right here my 
breaking point came when I went out to the parking lot together. Of 
all the carts. I spent nearly an hour collecting all of them by myself 
in the pouring rain, and when I walked back into the store, soaking 
wet from head to toe. The new manager that I got passed over
302
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:32.139
Copy Accelerator: the new manager I got passed over for, wrote me up 
for having an unprofessional appearance on the job. At that moment I 
broke. I got so frustrated because here I was working my heart out, 
giving it all, giving giving it
303
00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:53.159
Copy Accelerator: my all every day, but no matter, no matter how much 
effort I put in, it wouldn't get me anywhere. I knew there had to be 
another way. I didn't know what it was, but I knew I had to make 
something happen, otherwise I never be able to do things. I dreamed 
about all the time things like traveling the road, buying a home, 
pursuing other interests. So for the next 3 years I tried several 
different business models. So now we're kind of looking for truth 
answers like, what right this trigger thing is this Costco moment? Now 
he's looking for truth and answers.
304
00:38:53.520 --> 00:39:16.220
Copy Accelerator: I got my real estate license. I tried reselling 
products online, I got involved in the stock market. Are these 
business models have been around a super long time, and so the 
competition was extremely difficult. Then one day I stumbled across a 
newer business model private label and explain exactly how this unique 
business model works with private label. Now, here's kind of the 
difference with, I think, biz, OP, and it's kind of similar financial 
sometimes, actually, too, is.
305

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:28.210
Copy Accelerator: I think, biz up definitely can have a ump, and I'll 
talk about that what looks like. But in a case like this it kind of 
goes right into the solution. This case is sort of like, I tried these 
other things. They didn't work. Then I discovered this thing private 
label, and it did work right.
306
00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:41.770
Copy Accelerator: And it kind of goes right into. I'll go into this. 
Ums, first, st we go back to the ones. Right? Let me explain exactly 
how this unique business model works a private label. You have the 
opportunity to create your own brand made up of one or more physical 
products. You're able to work with manufacturers from all over the 
world to make products. And now there's absolutely no middle men.
307
00:39:41.770 --> 00:40:09.179
Copy Accelerator: Remember Shawn, the beginning. This is exactly what 
he did. What I love is. You don't have to re met the wheel or become 
some kind of vendor. With the right research methods. You can find out 
exactly what sells well on Amazon, and then reach out to manufacturer 
to help produce it for extremely low prices. Imagine, be able to 
source high quality, merchandise and products at the same prices, 
companies like Walmart and target to, and then put your own brand logo 
on it and sell it online. And since you're working directly with the 
supplier manufacturer, you have rock bottom pricing which allows for 
extremely high margins. I've seen my margins higher than 100. Return 
on investment.
308
00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:29.590
Copy Accelerator: Imagine you put a hundred dollars in and get back 
over $200, and you rinse and repeat that all over and over again, and 
this process of private label works fall asleep. Amazon. Let me show 
you how to find your 1st product, and it kind of goes into like 
showing them what to do and how it works, or anything like that. So a 
difference of biz OP. Is that you don't necessarily have a ump. Now 
you could have a ump right where it's sort of like, why, why would you 
need a ump if you were like
309
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:31.930
Copy Accelerator: talking to a market that has tried
310
00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:58.430
Copy Accelerator: drop shipping or private label on Amazon, you'd have 
to be like. Here's why most private label, the you know, I describe a 
thing called private label, you know, and specifically on Amazon. 

Maybe you've heard of that. Maybe you've heard of Fba, or you've heard 
of, like, you know, selling private label, maybe even tried it. And 
you haven't had any success, or you found that, you know it was way 
more hard than it sounded. If that's the case, I totally get it. Well, 
here's the one thing they don't tell you about private label right? 
And then sort of be like, you know, there's this one
311
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:20.209
Copy Accelerator: problem with the private label model or the Fba 
model. You know you can't, would give them some proof that exists and 
be like. And what I discovered is, if we could just actually solve 
that one problem, we could fix these issues. And then we could make 
private label actually work the way it's supposed to work. And so 
that's what I did, right? And so that's where you can have a ump in 
something like this, but I would say that in biz OP. More than other.
312
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:24.686
Copy Accelerator: you know, then health, for sure, you're able to 
actually skip the
313
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:32.248
Copy Accelerator: the Ump or the yeah, the ump part more often go 
right into a ums, especially for like a webinar or a sales team.
314
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:44.820
Copy Accelerator: so I think that's a really nuancing force. 
Somebody's knocking the door. My dogs and I go freak out. So we're 
gonna take a 1 min break, guys. I'm sorry. I don't know who's knocking 
my door. People should be knocking so 1 min.
315
00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.318
Copy Accelerator: Sorry, guys, I forgot the car detailer was coming 
today. Tough life of us raining out, so I'm not sure why he's clean.
316
00:42:11.610 --> 00:42:22.960
Copy Accelerator: Do I need? I need to figure out a how to get your 
dog to not bar? I need someone to make that course. Man, I I feel like 
I can do this. Spokesperson. Speaking of this right? I'd like the real 
problem. Dog training is that? You know.
317
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.849
Copy Accelerator: Well, actually, I watched a video of a good 
mechanism. I'll tell you this right? Because mechanisms are 

everywhere. And essentially it was like
318
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.419
Copy Accelerator: if you just sort of tell your dog no, or do whatever 
like
319
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:55.870
Copy Accelerator: you have to replace the behavior right? If you're 
trying to get rid of a bad behavior. You have to replace it with like 
a positive behavior if you replace, if you try to stop a bad behavior 
like barking, but you don't replace with something your dog feels like 
unsettled and like worse, right? And so you have to find a way to 
replace it. So essentially, you know, giving them like a treat, but 
you also have to do it in a way that your dog doesn't like. Think that 
he's being rewarded for scaring away the person. And the way the video 
mentioned is like.
320
00:42:56.010 --> 00:43:00.190
Copy Accelerator: right now you know your dog. Like he barks.
321
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:11.800
Copy Accelerator: you kind of go get them away. The person leaves your 
dogs like. Oh, I did my job. I crushed it right. And so it's like you 
have to make find a way to replace that behavior. However, I don't 
know. I also think my dogs just like an ingrained asshole.
322
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:30.840
Copy Accelerator: and he bit like a Amazon delivery driver. Speaking 
of Amazon, live in Arizona. I had to pay him $26,000, which was a 
super fun thing. So I don't know. Probably this dog is very lucky that 
he's owned by by my family and not anybody else. Yeah, it was. It 
wasn't a bad bite, by the way, and the guy was like, up in our 
driveway like 11 o'clock at night, and he walked up the driveway 
instead of bringing his truck up, anyway.
323
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:37.829
Copy Accelerator: I'm about to start to take him to Dog camp during 
these days. Okay, so anyway.
324
00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:41.859
Copy Accelerator: let's recap. Let me get this back on on schedule 
here. Right? So

325
00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:44.878
Copy Accelerator: okay, you've got the
326
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:46.923
Copy Accelerator: hey? Hey?
327
00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:52.710
Copy Accelerator: The guy's gone. So the dogs is barking like an 
asshole. Now, okay, so
328
00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:56.570
Copy Accelerator: that's the difference of something like, biz up. 
Okay, it goes right into the ums
329
00:43:58.610 --> 00:44:04.380
Copy Accelerator: and so let the us like, I said. It's usually pretty 
much like like, there's a logical connection between, like.
330
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.930
Copy Accelerator: like, all right. Now, you know the problem. Here's a 
solution, right? So if we go back to again new row.
331
00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:24.100
Copy Accelerator: we have this here right? So if you want to get 
relief from edema in your feet and legs, and if you want to reduce the 
swelling stiffness and aches, you need to stimulate your calves and 
their vein valves and your calves to reduce the buildup of the pulled 
blood and your calves and goes and feet. How do you do that?
332
00:44:24.130 --> 00:44:33.620
Copy Accelerator: Right like? So now you know the solution, a macro 
level. But what does that really mean? Right? So you know, now you 
have this macro solution. You gotta deeper improve that. There's 
something else in this case.
333
00:44:34.220 --> 00:45:02.140
Copy Accelerator: Right? Okay, most experts will tell you to move or 
start exercising. That's great advice. Don't get me wrong. Physical 
activities does wonders for simulating the vein valves in your calves. 
But let's be honest when you struggle, Fadema, and your fear also 
painful, moving around, let alone running and exercising, is just not 

possible. So you end up in this vicious cycle of agony. Your legs are 
sworn, painful, and the best way to relieve it is to activate your 
muscles, which can be done only be done by moving around. But you 
can't move because your legs are painful and swollen, so your feet and 
legs continue to expand like balloons ready to pop.
334
00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:08.530
Copy Accelerator: See how it works. That's why most people never 
really solve the problem and are stuck bedroom with painful, oversized 
clown feet and legs their entire lives.
335
00:45:08.530 --> 00:45:31.200
Copy Accelerator: Luckily there's now a better way. This is the 
quickest way to relieve edema, edema and swine. Your legs doesn't 
require exercise. It doesn't matter how old you are, how bad your 
current condition is. It doesn't matter if you're already very tried. 
Everything, but also no results. The simple, affordable doctor 
approved. By time ritual you can do at home has the power to stimulate 
the vein valves in your calves and relieve the stubborn swine as if 
you let the air out of balloon has 9 to do with existing solutions.
336
00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:39.979
Copy Accelerator: It's completely new. I know it existed. But then I 
discovered this thing called Nmes. So in this case, like, I mentioned 
this on our 1st call from 6, 11 June 11th
337
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:41.770
Copy Accelerator: it's almost like a two-part
338
00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:51.340
Copy Accelerator: solution. Not really. But it's really like they 
really have the macro. And like, now, I gotta figure out how to 
actually do it. In this case it's the Ems thing. And then this is 
actually where more of the proofing credibility comes in
339
00:45:51.370 --> 00:46:10.590
Copy Accelerator: is like on Nms. Right? So reviewed a review 
published in the Journal of rehabilitation. Medicine discussed 
studies, explore the use of Nmes for reducing edema in various 
clinical settings, including chronic, venous, and lymphatic 
conditions. The results across these studies are positive, 
demonstrating that Nmes could reduce lymph, swine, improve quality of 
life. So what is it? Technology?

340
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:17.079
Copy Accelerator: And it kind of goes in here and tells you it goes on 
to tell you how it works in the solution. Now, what I want to share 
with you is like.
341
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:27.340
Copy Accelerator: and by the for not that long. So just give you the 
like, the the how the solution works and the partners. And this is 
into the product, build and review, which we'll go over on the next 
call. If you look at the Beverly Hills, Pinch test
342
00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.010
Copy Accelerator: right? So if we go back to this one.
343
00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.634
Copy Accelerator: and he's like
344
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:36.949
Copy Accelerator: going through it? Asking these questions measures. 
The HT.
345
00:46:37.478 --> 00:46:40.129
Copy Accelerator: You know, explains the problem with it.
346
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.360
Copy Accelerator: Space, how it impacts collagen.
347
00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.800
Copy Accelerator: And as we had it here. Right? What does that do for 
routine?
348
00:46:47.040 --> 00:47:02.639
Copy Accelerator: Even though Joanne wasn't being on skincare makeup. 
For the past few years she had been taking a natural herb called salt 
and metal to help thicken her hair. Now, ordinarily salva Meadow is 
used to help combat hair loss, and men. In fact, Joanna said it was 
her husband who 1st introduced her to it, but she loved how full and 
healthy it made her hair look, too, so she figured. Why not
349
00:47:02.670 --> 00:47:20.599

Copy Accelerator: remember what I said about Dhc. Being linked to hair 
loss. Well, the reason Solveto is such an effective solution is, it 
helps naturally inhibit the effects of this hormone. Even as your 
body's production of it increases with age. So this is kind of where 
we're getting to the S. Here, it's like problem, is Dhc, in this case, 
we're sort of introducing that. There's an ingredient. And the 
ingredient.
350
00:47:21.036 --> 00:47:38.520
Copy Accelerator: you know, acts on dht, right? So it solves the 
problem, and it's logically connected. But then, like I was saying to 
our mean and human trials, people who took some metal report that 
significantly lower levels of Dhc in their system than the placebo 
group after just 6 months. So not only was this someone doing wonders 
for Joanne's hair, it was actually helping her skin stay firmer and 
more lifted looking, too.
351
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:49.560
Copy Accelerator: that said, if your goal is to look younger, taking 
solvent metal by itself won't do much good, because while it's great 
for stabilizing your body's natural collagen production. It doesn't 
make up for the collagen. It's already been lost.
352
00:47:49.590 --> 00:47:56.340
Copy Accelerator: But, as luck would have it, Joanne had unwindly been 
parent with something that does, and that's going to another 
ingredient. And so this is kind of interesting. Because.
353
00:47:56.490 --> 00:48:03.839
Copy Accelerator: like, I said, really, the unique mechanism of 
solutions like a 2 part thing here, right? Part of it's like, Stop, 
dht, because the Ics was kind of like
354
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:10.270
Copy Accelerator: killing your firmness of your skin and causing the 
sag. But then you also need to like, actually, you know.
355
00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:26.880
Copy Accelerator: store the firmness right? And he's like, so here's 
what the next part. And again, in this, in this case, and in some, 
health offers are structured this way. Like each of the unique 
mechanism, things is like or like. The ingredients are each part of 
the mechanism, and he kind of explains it. In this case these 2 
dietary supplements

356
00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:29.148
Copy Accelerator: that are helping right?
357
00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:31.060
Copy Accelerator: and it's
358
00:48:31.690 --> 00:48:33.839
Copy Accelerator: 3 assignments amino acids
359
00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:38.569
Copy Accelerator: and dietary harmonic acid or, yeah, dietary harmonic 
acid.
360
00:48:38.760 --> 00:48:44.619
Copy Accelerator: And it, you know, basically helps your skin. Explain 
how it does it. By the way they also impact. Dht, again.
361
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.669
Copy Accelerator: here's laronic acid. Here's why it helps
362
00:48:48.216 --> 00:48:53.799
Copy Accelerator: and then it has, like more studies, kind of 
supporting that this happened. So again. This is the part where you 
kind of layer in the studies.
363
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:56.470
Copy Accelerator: And then, finally, if we go back to our
364
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:58.780
Copy Accelerator: private label thing
365
00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.920
Copy Accelerator: in this case, it's really kind of going more to 
teaching mode.
366
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:04.530
Copy Accelerator: Right? He's teaching how this works right away.

367
00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.599
Copy Accelerator: So yeah, the margins are high.
368
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.790
Copy Accelerator: I started showing you like what you do with it. 
Right?
369
00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:14.660
Copy Accelerator: Let's make a sale. You know
370
00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:16.760
Copy Accelerator: Amazon takes care of everything else.
371
00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.330
Copy Accelerator: Let's see, leverages the power of Amazon a few days.
372
00:49:25.630 --> 00:49:45.879
Copy Accelerator: and it sort of just goes in. I mean this part again. 
The Us. Is a little different. I think I'll do this biz up one as a 
whole separate section. But I want to show you how the background 
story part was really the same right now you hit on a ump, and then 
how this you there's a unique mechanism here. I'll share this 
resource, too. But basically I do want to go through biz up on like a 
whole day of biz off, and we do some short Vsls and other funnel 
formats, too.
373
00:49:46.164 --> 00:49:53.430
Copy Accelerator: But the goal of this right now is to kind of just go 
through like these structural things. So you kind of start thinking 
about, okay, what's in the background story?
374
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:55.410
Copy Accelerator: What's the need? Because of the problem?
375
00:49:55.490 --> 00:50:03.260
Copy Accelerator: If you have one. And then what's like the solution? 
Right? And the kind of how are you presenting it? And again, 
typically, it is like.
376
00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:08.609

Copy Accelerator: this is the general solution, but I had to dial it 
in right for biz OP.
377
00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:21.980
Copy Accelerator: This is general solution. I discovered I had to dial 
it in right for health. It's like the general solution is to fix the 
system or processing your body. But how do you actually do it? Well, 
these ingredients, right? And so
378
00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:28.019
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I don't know. I just wanted to go over. I'm 
like again. I just, I'm trying to think what the issues I see when I 
review
379
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:31.670
Copy Accelerator: people's vsls, and Ca pro for feedback.
380
00:50:32.450 --> 00:50:35.700
Copy Accelerator: I think the background story one would be sometimes 
that it's too long
381
00:50:36.685 --> 00:50:37.280
Copy Accelerator: like.
382
00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:43.380
Copy Accelerator: But, for example, the pain story like this is good, 
but it has to keep moving like you saw that with a
383
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:49.870
Copy Accelerator: the Beverly Hills, Md. One. I think that was the biz 
OP one here, right? The high ticket.
384
00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.426
Copy Accelerator: The one thing I do think is like,
385
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.740
Copy Accelerator: you know, it doesn't really relate this back to the 
the viewer ever throughout
386
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:08.660

Copy Accelerator: right kind of shares. This story I joined. I did, 
Costco. i i i i right. It's kind of got eye syndrome, what I would 
call it. And so I do think one thing that would make this stronger is 
like.
387
00:51:09.270 --> 00:51:10.400
Copy Accelerator: you know.
388
00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:21.054
Copy Accelerator: so I don't know how you you know what you think 
about Costco, but for a kid like me coming out of high school, it 
sound like an amazing opportunity. Right?
389
00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:27.040
Copy Accelerator: you know, it's like I thought they could see my 
work, ethic and responsibility as employee.
390
00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:29.070
Copy Accelerator: I'll be soon for a sorry jump.
391
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:44.290
Copy Accelerator: But the longer I worked more realized that no matter 
how hard I worked. The system wasn't set toward the best workers. 
Instead, every time a management spot opened they would always pick 
the person who had been working there the longest, despite the fact 
that I worked circles around the same people like, Have you? Have you 
ever been in a job like that? Maybe in a job like that right now, 
where it's like.
392
00:51:44.470 --> 00:52:12.619
Copy Accelerator: it's hard to stay motivated, because, you know, it 
doesn't matter how much you effort you put in. You know, there's a 
hierarchy, or like a system where you know the people who are 
seniority system. And you know they talk about America, how you know 
hard work, I think, is possible. But the reality is when you're part 
of some big corporate machine. It's also about hard work and more 
about, you know. Can you keep training water long enough until someone 
pulls you up until, like, you know, gives you the gift of like upper 
management or management at all? And you know
393
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:27.659
Copy Accelerator: those timelines can be brutal, too, right? Well, you 
know, that's how was the Costco for me, at least, and it really upset 

me, because here. I was giving it my all working hard than any 
everyone, right? So it's just like those little things you could do to 
check it in. Like to me. That's like, I think, an opportunity for this 
swipe here, if I was doing it, is like
394
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:33.060
Copy Accelerator: trying to check in with the with the reader a bit 
more. And I think that's something that people sometimes
395
00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.310
Copy Accelerator: struggle with, too.
396
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:49.459
Copy Accelerator: the mechanisms I've I've talked about it, you know, 
a bit before. But like, I think it's really just sort of over 
complicating them. And then, like we talked about, I did a whole 
session on mechanisms, for who's newer. You can go back and look at it 
on the weekly call recordings. But like
397
00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:55.259
Copy Accelerator: it needs to be saying, you can really instantly 
grasp and go share with somebody if you do. Wmp, right? So it's like
398
00:52:55.770 --> 00:52:58.290
Copy Accelerator: DHT. Is a hormone that
399
00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:07.550
Copy Accelerator: basically destroys collagen in your skin. It makes a 
sag, so you want to stop dht, from doing that. It gets worse during 
menopause. You want to stop dht, from doing that. And you want to kind 
of increase college and production.
400
00:53:07.810 --> 00:53:15.410
Copy Accelerator: You won't have wrinkles right? That's sort of the 
mechanism idea for that. For the newer one. It's like
401
00:53:15.630 --> 00:53:26.960
Copy Accelerator: your heart sends blood down to your calves, your 
calves like contract and pump blood back up to your heart. But if 
those muscles weaken because you're sitting, or you get older. 
Whatever it is, they can't contract. Blood doesn't go to your heart 
instead of pools. That's why you have edema

402
00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:54.720
Copy Accelerator: right? So easy cause. The problem that people will 
do is like, go about doing neuros. An example. It's like in the 
calves. What's this in the calves? This hormone called Bh 5, 1. i'm 
just making that up right? Like it's released. Bh, 5, 1, you know, 
targets the mitochondria in your cells. And when the cells become less 
active, and this goes to your lymph lymphomatic golf like goals, which 
is part of your gut, which is like they try and add so much other shit 
in. And it's like. Now, it's hard for me to explain it. So like, how 
do you keep the mechanism towards? Very like it's legit
403
00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:02.599
Copy Accelerator: like it really makes sense. There's like, you know, 
it's believable, and there's proof elements, but that also you could 
hear it one or 2 times, and just go tell somebody like, Hey, here's
404
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:20.930
Copy Accelerator: like, Oh, this is why, you know you have edema. This 
is like, you know, like this, doctor, this plastic surgeon, Guy. I was 
talking about Dhc, like my husband and talk said he heard of it, but I 
didn't know. Had us. Woman had to worry about it right, whatever it 
is. And again. If this was like sort of an Fba thing like if there was 
Ump in here, I'd be like.
405
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:27.270
Copy Accelerator: you know, like, Oh, dude like, yeah, like, that's I 
watched a video from this guy where, like private label stuff is is
406
00:54:27.757 --> 00:54:41.750
Copy Accelerator: this is a huge mistake. Ever makes a private label 
that like, you know, here's the thing that will tell you about private 
label or Fba, right? Like, here's the issue with it. But actually 
like, apparently, if you do this other thing it can be really 
successful. Right? So it's gotta be like that really like
407
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:43.330
Copy Accelerator: intuitive thing.
408
00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.369
Copy Accelerator: and then on the side, I think, like
409

00:54:48.320 --> 00:55:03.199
Copy Accelerator: it's pretty self explanatory. To be honest with you. 
It's just a matter of like. Okay, here's like the solution solidly 
connected. We kind of summed up what the problem was. So that's the 
problem. Here's the solution. And then kind of like, what was that 
actually look like? And for health, it's like ingredients
410
00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:09.850
Copy Accelerator: for biz up. It's like a system or a way to sell on 
Amazon, and he sort of got getting into that sort of like the how of 
it.
411
00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:18.240
Copy Accelerator: So we pause there and and don't have questions 
specific to this training. And then let's do that first.st And then 
after that you've got more broad, specific questions. I'm happy to 
answer some of those, too.
412
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:23.522
Copy Accelerator: Okay, let's talk for an hour minus the dog.
413
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:24.950
Copy Accelerator: the dog! Break!
414
00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:37.990
Copy Accelerator: Stop sharing it. Did it make sense what I was going 
through and sharing I was on. I'm going looking examples, helps. I do. 
Once we go through this whole training, too. I do want to just go 
dissect several Vsls, I think
415
00:55:38.306 --> 00:55:41.870
Copy Accelerator: like in different niches and categories, and we can 
see where it
416
00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:45.538
Copy Accelerator: aligns where it doesn't. We're doing that now, but I 
think it'd be good to do it with like
417
00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.359
Copy Accelerator: I don't know from like start to finish, too
418

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.140
Copy Accelerator: good money said it made sense.
419
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:54.890
Copy Accelerator: Anyone got any questions, though?
420
00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:57.830
Copy Accelerator: Anything alright. I'll open it up to then, I guess, 
who has
421
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.879
Copy Accelerator: general questions, you know, or specific questions.
422
00:56:02.090 --> 00:56:03.290
Copy Accelerator: feel free to share.
423
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:14.559
Thea Lawson: I have a general question. We are looking for some split 
test ideas for our emails like pretty general. And what would you 
suggest.
424
00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:18.359
Copy Accelerator: I mean, I feel like.
425
00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:27.989
Copy Accelerator: you know. Obviously, the my mind goes some a lot of 
the basic stuff. So you may already know all this right. But I mean to 
me it would be like obviously
426
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:35.779
Copy Accelerator: subject lines, you know, from names preview text, 
like, obviously, just like all those kind of tests, a different copy,
427
00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.660
Copy Accelerator: emojis.
428
00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:42.808
Copy Accelerator: like using emojis and sort of like the different 
fields. I see people have a lot of success with that, especially

429
00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:49.399
Copy Accelerator: especially in the from name or or sorry, actually, 
from the subject line. So that's a from name, too.
430
00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:54.080
Copy Accelerator: you know, I think, doing no preview text. I'd be 
curious about that.
431
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.019
Copy Accelerator: you know, image versus no image. Obviously
432
00:56:58.750 --> 00:57:04.230
Copy Accelerator: the location of the Cta right? Do you do a call to 
action link up high, or do you wait until it's lower
433
00:57:04.620 --> 00:57:12.970
Copy Accelerator: the length as well as like, you know, or with 
regards to like I, you know, depending where you're where you're 
sending to. But it's like a Vsl or a longer form page like.
434
00:57:13.380 --> 00:57:17.829
Copy Accelerator: you know, typically shorter does better. So it's 
like, if you take some of your best emails that are
435
00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:23.330
Copy Accelerator: longer, and you try and like, do versions that are 
half the length or a 3rd of the length like what happens?
436
00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:34.850
Copy Accelerator: those are so many media ones. I don't think those 
are that revolutionary, but I'm happy to. If you add more contacts or 
maybe share. If I'm not answering correctly as well, let me know I'm 
happy to.
437
00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.649
Thea Lawson: This is exactly what I needed. Thank you.
438
00:57:37.650 --> 00:57:38.360
Copy Accelerator: Okay. Alright!

439
00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:40.579
Armin Farah: Let's chime in one thing, too.
440
00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:57.750
Armin Farah: done lots of email, split testing. And the one thing that 
we find that it's often list specific or like niche specific. But the 
length of the subject line, like I've found in some lists like a 25 
character
441
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:59.530
Armin Farah: subject line
442
00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:06.020
Armin Farah: will way outperform like 5 or 6 words subject line every 
single time depending on the list. Yeah.
443
00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:06.650
Copy Accelerator: But you didn't.
444
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:07.360
Thea Lawson: Staying.
445
00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.519
Copy Accelerator: Why do you think that is.
446
00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:14.669
Armin Farah: Well, I don't know. I look at my when I look at my inbox. 
Mostly I see
447
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:23.890
Armin Farah: subject lines that are definitely longer than 20 to 25 
characters, and if you can figure out how to communicate your point
448
00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:30.409
Armin Farah: in such a short like 25 characters sometimes is like 2 
words depends on like, what words are you using?
449
00:58:30.750 --> 00:58:31.690
Armin Farah: And so.

450
00:58:32.007 --> 00:58:38.030
Copy Accelerator: 25 characters was longer, not shorter. So you're 
saying, even like super short, like 2 word subject lines when.
451
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:39.580
Armin Farah: Totally. Yeah.
452
00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:40.210
Copy Accelerator: Okay, that makes.
453
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.960
Armin Farah: Sometimes. Sometimes. 3. Words. Yeah, yeah.
454
00:58:43.390 --> 00:58:43.825
Copy Accelerator: Okay.
455
00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:47.799
Copy Accelerator: that makes sense. I thought you're sorry. I was kind 
of hearing that like
456
00:58:47.900 --> 00:59:00.619
Copy Accelerator: a long ass subject line, which I'm like. But I'm 
like, well, maybe someone feels like, Oh, it must be from my crazy 
relative or something. You know what I mean. And so they open it. 
Okay, yeah, that that that's a good insight that makes a lot of sense. 
So yeah.
457
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.689
Thea Lawson: Thank you.
458
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:08.250
Copy Accelerator: I think about yeah, I think the firm names are 
always really interesting, too. Like.
459
00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:10.670
Copy Accelerator: yeah, anyway.
460
00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:14.560

Thea Lawson: And Stanley style like. Who who is this.
461
00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:15.729
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, exactly. Right?
462
00:59:15.730 --> 00:59:16.650
Thea Lawson: The box.
463
00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.710
Copy Accelerator: And I do think I do think like sort of like those.
464
00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.970
Copy Accelerator: those subject lines that are very like
465
00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:30.860
Copy Accelerator: that just almost feel like it could be from a friend 
like obviously like you'll like, you'll see this in in campaigns and 
auto responder auto responder campaigns for like
466
00:59:31.160 --> 00:59:46.710
Copy Accelerator: sales sequences of like, you know, quick question, 
like question like meet question. Mark. You know what I mean. Things 
like that. Especially. There's no preview cause. Then people will 
like, I'll still fall for those and open them sometimes from like 
someone like Perry Belcher, or like Frank Kern, where, like.
467
00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:56.230
Copy Accelerator: like, we actually do email, you know what I mean, 
like, it's like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I know, this is just an 
email from them. But I'm like, Let me have like, make sure I don't 
want to miss an email from
468
00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.160
Copy Accelerator: Frank or from Perry. You know what I mean. So those 
cannot also, I think, do really? Well.
469
01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:08.930
Armin Farah: We have a con. We have a control running, I thought, just 
throw this into the control running up on one of our brands, and
470

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:09.550
Armin Farah: they're
471
01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.890
Armin Farah: It's RE, or order.
472
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:16.015
Armin Farah: Yeah, like, it looks like a reply
473
01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:29.129
Armin Farah: to something that they per they purchased. You know. You 
gotta be a little bit careful, because the inbox providers don't like. 
When you kind of try to cheat the system by saying it's a reply when 
it's really not so. You have to have really good deliverability to do 
that. But
474
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:31.320
Armin Farah: anyway.
475
01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:33.650
Armin Farah: great.
476
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.679
Copy Accelerator: Thank you. Good question.
477
01:00:37.566 --> 01:00:43.890
Jay Topp: I've got a question around the split testing about how much 
data
478
01:00:44.020 --> 01:00:49.890
Jay Topp: that you need or how many purchases that you want to see on 
a on a split test to be like, okay, this is like
479
01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:54.460
Jay Topp: an accurate representation of like the change that's been 
that's been made.
480
01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.059
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I.

481
01:00:57.140 --> 01:01:04.829
Copy Accelerator: So as far as I interviewed several cro experts 
right? Cause of like we're hiring. And I mean, I think I'm a Cr. 
Expert, too, but I'm trying to hire one for our
482
01:01:05.962 --> 01:01:11.820
Copy Accelerator: you know the Peptide Company, and it so people do 
this full time. It's like the only thing they do. And I kept asking 
them like, When do you
483
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:17.919
Copy Accelerator: consider a test like? Significantly, you know, 
valid, or whatever right or or statistically significant.
484
01:01:18.510 --> 01:01:19.760
Copy Accelerator: and
485
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:27.089
Copy Accelerator: they all give me like weird answer. I mean 
essentially that most of them are using something like convert com or 
another platform or tool. And so they sort of like.
486
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:29.150
Copy Accelerator: wait until that sort of confidence
487
01:01:29.761 --> 01:01:32.920
Copy Accelerator: interval is like 95%, which is usually
488
01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.030
Copy Accelerator: it can vary. But you know
489
01:01:35.270 --> 01:01:37.169
Copy Accelerator: it's typically over
490
01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:40.010
Copy Accelerator: if we're doing it based on conversions, you know.
491
01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:42.700
Copy Accelerator: I probably like to see like 300

492
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:44.150
Copy Accelerator: bus sales.
493
01:01:44.340 --> 01:01:46.459
Copy Accelerator: It also depends on
494
01:01:47.220 --> 01:02:00.360
Copy Accelerator: the traffic source, and like the time, I think the 
timeframe is kind of important to right cause. Say you did like 300 
sales, or in your case, you're doing a lot of Cpl or not. Cpl, you're 
doing a low ticket front end to like higher ticket stuff, right? So 
like, you know, you might get
495
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:09.469
Copy Accelerator: 300, you know conversions for like a low ticket book 
funnel. And let's say you get that in like 3 days is, I'm not saying 
your numbers are just as like a example.
496
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:15.749
Jay Topp: Yeah, we do. 500 books like 3 to 500 books a month. 500 is a 
good month. We're probably averaging like 300.
497
01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:28.779
Copy Accelerator: And so maybe you know, it could be that it's a 
little bit like even lower for you guys. But the the point I'm trying 
to make. And one thing that that I think Jason may mention on the 
meeting call, too. But I they I think I know that Sarah people was 
talking about. It is like you really do need.
498
01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:35.059
Copy Accelerator: There needs to usually be a time horizon cause if 
you look at saying like with Meta, for example, like Meta, will have 
like
499
01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:38.919
Copy Accelerator: 2 or 3 days where Meta traffic is kind of shitty, 
right? And then
500
01:02:39.202 --> 01:02:46.289
Copy Accelerator: a week, where it's amazing. And like the Cpa is way 

lower. And so the problem is, if you just run it just on sales, for, 
like.
501
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:53.159
Copy Accelerator: you know, a short period of time. But you get like 
enough sales. You have to make sure it's not like a case of like.
502
01:02:53.990 --> 01:03:00.989
Copy Accelerator: you know. Met again, Meta, like you know, that was 
just like that that was based on the traffic, and it was serving it to 
more people who liked one thing than another thing. So
503
01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:07.319
Copy Accelerator: I I think that's the other really important thing to 
keep in mind when you're looking at the statistical significance of a 
of a test. I think it's like.
504
01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.829
Copy Accelerator: you know again, probably like
505
01:03:10.050 --> 01:03:12.790
Copy Accelerator: 200 sales, depend on amount of volume. Obviously.
506
01:03:13.510 --> 01:03:17.039
Copy Accelerator: it's hard like, because you want to be able to run 
several split tests
507
01:03:17.270 --> 01:03:18.719
Copy Accelerator: a month right?
508
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.460
Copy Accelerator: But at the same time they're not actually.
509
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:27.229
Jay Topp: That's where I'm struggling. Because, yeah, I'm getting 
obviously like a big variation from Meta as well.
510
01:03:27.499 --> 01:03:42.979
Jay Topp: On, like, you know. Yeah, you can have like a cracking few 
days with Cpas like half, and I'm like holy fuck. I've just cracked 

the funnel. Let's go. But then it pulled back, and then, at the same 
time, I want to test so many fucking things like, I want to be running 
like a split test a week or something.
511
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:44.790
Jay Topp: but probably just don't have enough.
512
01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.560
Jay Topp: Yeah, there's probably not enough data there in that 
timeframe that.
513
01:03:48.900 --> 01:04:05.900
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I mean, the the idea would be I mean, the 2 
thoughts I'd have on that is like, obviously the good news is like 
when split, test do when and conversions go up, and your see, your cac 
goes down and like. If whatever right then that enables you to acquire 
more customers, which means you can run more split test. So it's sort 
of like snowballs.
514
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:09.640
Copy Accelerator: right? So sometimes it might be patience. I mean, 
the other thing is, you know, you can.
515
01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:12.409
Copy Accelerator: depending on what you're testing for, like.
516
01:04:13.170 --> 01:04:18.930
Copy Accelerator: you know, you can generally test something on the 
front end and on the back end simultaneously, right? Like. So
517
01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:26.759
Copy Accelerator: like, if you were trying to look at how thing on the 
front end impacts overall. Aov, let's say like, then I know you're not 
doing like it goes like a book, a call thing. But like, if you're 
trying to test that like.
518
01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:32.560
Copy Accelerator: well, I got your funnel right. You have front end 
like like book. Let's take a book
519
01:04:32.970 --> 01:04:39.349

Copy Accelerator: fairly low. Ticket upsell one and upsell 2 is like 
book a call. Right? I think that's how your funnel is, or the one you 
showed me.
520
01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.350
Jay Topp: Book of Calls, like Post Purchase book of calls on the 
Confirmation page.
521
01:04:43.350 --> 01:04:47.219
Copy Accelerator: What was what was the upsell to was like a higher 
ticket, 497 thing, or something, or.
522
01:04:47.850 --> 01:04:51.819
Jay Topp: We've got like 5 different funnels going, but it's 
essentially like
523
01:04:51.860 --> 01:05:02.049
Jay Topp: 5 to $15 book, and then usually like a 29 to $47, second 
upsell, and then, like a 97 or a 197 second upsell.
524
01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:02.960
Copy Accelerator: Yeah.
525
01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:04.760
Copy Accelerator: And so
526
01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:07.929
Copy Accelerator: it depends. It depends on what you're testing for, 
right? But
527
01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:23.019
Copy Accelerator: it's hard. Because in my head, I'm like, well, if 
you test something on the front end to see the conversion rates like, 
and then you tested going right to the 197 upsell right like cause. 
Then if the take around, that's higher, then the overall AV is good. 
But the problem that's paying the ass is like.
528
01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:30.160
Copy Accelerator: what if changing that thing on the front end impacts 
Aob like negatively. And then you do this right? And so.

529
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:52.630
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I probably like realistically, you just have 
to do a few tests pick like the highest leverage test. You know what I 
mean. Now, hey, you do have 5 funnels, right? So that's actually huge 
advantage. Because you could do. They're pretty similar, right? These 
phones are pretty similar each time. So it's actually huge. For you. 
Cause you can basically do one test. You can have run 5 tests at a 
time. Actually. So that's that's that's actually pretty good.
530
01:05:52.980 --> 01:06:09.260
Jay Topp: That's a good way to think about it. Yeah. Cause yeah, even 
like the other day, I I did a test, and that re like it, dropped the 
Aov significant sorry. Drop the Cpa. Significantly. But then it also 
it took just as much. Iov with it. Yeah.
531
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:19.979
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, but that's where I think I think what you 
should focus on is like, you know, maybe one test per funnel. But you 
have 5 funnels. So you can run cause they can basically run 5 a month. 
And I'll see a lot of like the again talking to these really
532
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:23.340
Copy Accelerator: like world class Cro people that's like all they do.
533
01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:29.179
Copy Accelerator: India, we're working them, too. I mean, generally 
they're trying to do like 4 to 6 tests per month.
534
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:48.789
Copy Accelerator: but they also are trying to do the ones that they 
really think are going to be large. Neal mover wins versus like the 
incremental cause. There's always idea of like change, the color of 
the button change like that right? Which and that those are those 
stories of like, I changed the tech. I mean, I had one for one of my 
phones back in the day, where I changed what was on the buy now 
button, and like conversions increased by like
535
01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:54.140
Copy Accelerator: 20% or something crazy. Right? So it definitely.
536
01:06:54.950 --> 01:07:04.820
Copy Accelerator: those things are cool. But they're kind of trying to 

figure out like, how can we get like that big win? And the guys we 
hired are also like we will. They're like, we'll change several things 
at a time like we might just do a totally different variant of a 
landing page.
537
01:07:04.890 --> 01:07:30.973
Copy Accelerator: and we can kind of figure it out later on, like 
which element it was that one by then. I don't care if I got you a 15 
or 20 lift. That's what I'm most happy about, versus like, you know, 
needing to know if it was because, like the headline was different, or 
the color was different or whatever. And so that's a little 
controversial. Other people feel it really like. But then you won't 
know what the variable was, but they're sort of like. Who cares right 
like? Who cares if you got a lift of 1520 so you could take that 
approach.
538
01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:44.209
Copy Accelerator: But yeah, generally, I would say, like, yeah, just 
one thing at a time. 5 different things over enough, you know. A 
couple of weeks, probably realistically, and probably at least, you're 
under sales. I remember you tried saying, Nick from. Be sure the CEO 
told me that
539
01:07:44.990 --> 01:07:47.670
Copy Accelerator: now I don't think you should do this, but he was. He 
was like yo
540
01:07:47.770 --> 01:07:50.599
Copy Accelerator: people should really let their split test run to 
like, you know.
541
01:07:50.931 --> 01:07:58.559
Copy Accelerator: You know, a thousand or 2,000 sales, because we'll 
find that the, you know, sometimes it changes after a thousand sales. 
And I'm like, Yeah, but you guys are doing like, you know, 3,000
542
01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:02.995
Copy Accelerator: 4,000 sales a day. So it's a lot easier to do that, 
you know.
543
01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:13.649
Copy Accelerator: But yeah, I don't know. I I would say, probably 
yeah, at least a couple of 100 and over a bit of a timeframe. Because 

again, I think that's really important, because things will average 
out and isn't just metas traffic. But again, you have 5 different 
funnels to do it on.
544
01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:18.308
Jay Topp: Yeah, yeah. Awesome. That gives me some clarity. Appreciate 
it.
545
01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:19.340
Copy Accelerator: For sure
546
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:23.830
Copy Accelerator: anyone else got any questions. I'm happy to jam for 
a little bit, and we've got any general questions and stuff.
547
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.279
Mony Zarazua: I do?
548
01:08:28.649 --> 01:08:29.289
Copy Accelerator: Cool.
549
01:08:29.569 --> 01:08:34.829
Mony Zarazua: Yeah. So you've been sharing like your how you've been 
growing your Peptide company.
550
01:08:34.929 --> 01:08:48.699
Mony Zarazua: And you said last year, like November, December, you 
were at like a 16,000 a month. And now you're in millions. So what was 
like the biggest needle changer? So like, why do you guys focus on 
mainly to grow like that.
551
01:08:49.410 --> 01:08:51.018
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, it's a great question.
552
01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:53.479
Copy Accelerator: so
553
01:08:53.490 --> 01:08:55.410
Copy Accelerator: I mean the biggest one.

554
01:08:56.300 --> 01:09:02.012
Copy Accelerator: the one I've really been focusing on and harnessing 
and or talking about a lot is harping on. Let's say not harnessing is
555
01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:06.770
Copy Accelerator: kind of like that effective cpa, right? So sort of 
like, what are the things that
556
01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:16.070
Copy Accelerator: like, I'm not sure how you're gonna talk about. I 
want to be a dead horse. But essentially like I, I still think it's 
like the most important thing and secret to like scaling offers. And I 
think people aren't
557
01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:20.449
Copy Accelerator: paying enough attention to it or understanding it. 
And I sort of feel like it's just unfair advantage.
558
01:09:21.729 --> 01:09:25.249
Copy Accelerator: And so what I'm you know. Essentially, that's like, 
okay, I'm paying
559
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:31.110
Copy Accelerator: rough math like $300 to acquire a customer on 
metalists. That's not actually true. But just say I'm paying $300
560
01:09:31.120 --> 01:09:35.960
Copy Accelerator: right? So I'm a new customer that I, my ad spend. 
You know my my cost, acquire my cac
561
01:09:36.109 --> 01:09:39.970
Copy Accelerator: on your Meta is $300, right? But then
562
01:09:40.279 --> 01:09:48.390
Copy Accelerator: I'm paying my call center to call abandons and 
people who didn't buy. And they're, you know, selling people for $75 
per person.
563
01:09:48.500 --> 01:10:04.602
Copy Accelerator: right? And then I'm texting people. And it's going 

to like that's basically free or like a dollar, you know, per person. 
And we have a manicard emails. And you know, if you prorate all that 
out, it's like, you know, basically a few dollars. So it's called 
free, the text and and the emails right?
564
01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:07.830
Copy Accelerator: then, like my costs, acquire
565
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.079
Copy Accelerator: a new customer on average
566
01:10:10.220 --> 01:10:16.820
Copy Accelerator: for the day. My Cpa or the effective Cpa effective. 
Cac. However, say it right goes down dramatically, too. So if it goes 
down dramatically.
567
01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:31.299
Copy Accelerator: because, instead of paying $300 to acquire each new 
customer if I just was doing better, not doing all that other stuff, 
because I'm doing all that other stuff. Let's say I'm paying $150, and 
let's say, my, you know, profit margin is like $180. I'm like, well, I 
can spend $30 more
568
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:38.699
Copy Accelerator: to acquire a customer right? And so it sounds weird. 
But that's really one of the biggest things I've I've focused on is 
like, how do we?
569
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:47.070
Copy Accelerator: How do we optimize to that, because again, if we 
optimize and that's still what we're doing. Frankly, I saw our email 
still a shit show. But it's going to be fixed in the next few weeks.
570
01:10:47.332 --> 01:10:55.350
Copy Accelerator: We've you know, Brian, these list managers doing 
what they're doing. We've got the SMS stuffs of kind of pain, the ass 
of what we were using go high level. But
571
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:58.259
Copy Accelerator: oh! And, by the way, if I want to sell them.
572

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:03.789
Copy Accelerator: you know, obviously monetizing the abandoned cards 
who don't buy like on the call center and all that stuff like.
573
01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:13.316
Copy Accelerator: okay, we could send them like white hat affiliate 
offers. We're a brand. So we're gonna do white hat stuff. But like, 
maybe the native path, or V shred, or whatever it is, what about 
coaching like like? Well, we can do.
574
01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:29.160
Copy Accelerator: if people have like a high, you know, low ticket 
medium ticket, high ticket coaching for like, you know, weight loss, 
nutritional stuff exercise fitness plans, things like that. They're 
gonna help them get better results and get off the medications like we 
can sell them that I've got a friend who's got nationwide meal meal 
delivery. And I can sell all that stuff.
575
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:32.420
Copy Accelerator: not just for the Ltv, but basically
576
01:11:32.940 --> 01:12:02.139
Copy Accelerator: within the 1st week. And so as that starts 
compounding, and I'm making more money for every abandoned cart that 
comes in that still kind of contributes to this effective Cpa and 
lowers it and allows us to scale and then brand equity, how do we 
build like a brand? Well, we're going to do Instagram. We're doing 
like a Youtube. We have a whole higher content, marketing strategy. 
Right? So people go search for us and see like a real social presence. 
They trust us more likely to buy conversion rates kind of go up right. 
And then on top of that, we're doing Cro, because if it converts 
higher, then the Cpa lowers, the entire thing is like, how do I,
577
01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:17.660
Copy Accelerator: in a world where our competitors are paying $400 on 
average, to acquire a customer? And you know, Roman and some other big 
companies that have much of Vc. Money, or whatever or public, are 
paying $600 to acquire customer. And we're paying 100 $5,060.
578
01:12:17.690 --> 01:12:19.440
Copy Accelerator: I'm essentially like, how do I?
579
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:29.909

Copy Accelerator: How do I also pay $600 to on Facebook, but not have 
to go in the whole bunch of money or go take, you know, Vc, money, or 
whatever it is. And so it's really just been.
580
01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:40.290
Copy Accelerator: you know. Obviously, there's like stuff like split 
test and and testing different things of the questionnaire. And things 
increase the conversion rate. And that's what the Cr people are coming 
for. But that's really been the the biggest focus.
581
01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:44.646
Copy Accelerator: and it makes a really big difference, like I'll show 
you. I'll just pull this up. Give me a second. Here,
582
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.840
Copy Accelerator: fix
583
01:12:46.050 --> 01:12:47.570
Copy Accelerator: Cpa tracker.
584
01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.040
Copy Accelerator: I've shared this in like
585
01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:52.770
Copy Accelerator: the business owner chat a bit. But like, let me.
586
01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.189
Copy Accelerator: if I can make this big
587
01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.330
Copy Accelerator: okay, yeah, let me
588
01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.639
Copy Accelerator: me share.
589
01:13:03.820 --> 01:13:11.330
Copy Accelerator: Okay? So like, you know, last couple of like days, 
or whatever right? So kind of like new customers, that kind of come in
590

01:13:11.530 --> 01:13:16.020
Copy Accelerator: obviously got rebuilds that are compounding. This is 
sort of our daily ad spend.
591
01:13:16.407 --> 01:13:18.790
Copy Accelerator: This is only counting people who were like
592
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:20.290
Copy Accelerator: the sale
593
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:23.709
Copy Accelerator: like we still have a huge gap right now between this 
and then, like our
594
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:38.041
Copy Accelerator: people who go through the checkout. But then they 
have to like send a photo of id and stuff. So if we counted that or 
Cp. But we make kind of people like they're good they got. They're 
getting the medication. They're approved. So it's a huge opportunity 
here. So, knowing the numbers is super helpful, right? These abandoned 
carts and these are not abandoned carts like
595
01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:49.070
Copy Accelerator: these are basically post check out abandoned cards 
where they build into credit, card and everything. But then they have 
to do a few steps before we can charge them. So that's a really big 
OP. Opportunity. But I'll show you the difference right where it's 
like.
596
01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.390
Copy Accelerator: like, if we look at
597
01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:54.400
Copy Accelerator: is this one here?
598
01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:55.910
Copy Accelerator: So there's 2 of these.
599
01:13:56.180 --> 01:14:01.319
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, this one, right? So this is like our media, 
like Jason Katowski, right? Who came on last week. So like yesterday.

600
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:05.189
Copy Accelerator: Right? He when we count paying them.
601
01:14:05.628 --> 01:14:10.569
Copy Accelerator: You know, like what they what they spent to Co. 
Their cost, require customer on Facebook.
602
01:14:15.221 --> 01:14:43.019
Copy Accelerator: Right? It was $268. Look at what? What do we, Co. 
What did it cost us to acquire each of those new customers yesterday? 
Not just our all new customers told yesterday it was $166. Right? So 
it's a matter like a hundred dollar difference. Okay? Well, like, why? 
Why was it that huge difference? 47 difference? Right, and that's 
that's not including rebills and things like that, right which this is 
a medication people rebuild on the good time, and you can see very 
yesterday was especially good. Why was it better than these 2 days? 
Right? Well, if we go over like the call center
603
01:14:44.140 --> 01:15:06.649
Copy Accelerator: yesterday the call center made 74 fucking sales, 
which was crazy, right? Like 299 on average, the day 2 days before 
they had 24, and 25, so they can look at it. But then, you know, in 
general (495) 350-6459. So they're on a hot streak, right? But they, 
and why were they shitty here? They had turnover on some agents. They 
had to hire new agents, and so like knowing that metrics also really 
important to know right? Because then you're like, okay like
604
01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:07.803
Copy Accelerator: that explains,
605
01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:12.359
Copy Accelerator: when we're looking at the kind of effective Cpa. For
606
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:21.350
Copy Accelerator: you know, the 2 previous days, and then assess with 
rebuilds for the 2 previous days. And yesterday, you're like, Oh, 
well, that explains it right there alone, right? And then,
607
01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:32.720
Copy Accelerator: yeah, yeah, these are good days. They had right? Why 
was this effective? Cpa, so again, we know we're essentially acquiring 

new customers profitably right now, now, the email stuff like, I said 
is should be doing like
608
01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:56.759
Copy Accelerator: if the email SMS is where I think it should be. Our 
like effective Cpa should be like $100 $110 right now, which means we 
could tell Jason. Hey? You can spend extra $100 per customer you 
acquire right, which enable us to easily double or triple the amount 
of customers are acquiring right now. It also can mean we could go to 
like affiliate networks. We're not working with, like a, you know, a 
bunch of affiliate networks. We have a few traffic partners like 
Gide's trying to make this work with us and another one and we can be 
like, Hey.
609
01:15:56.850 --> 01:16:07.279
Copy Accelerator: you know, our competitors are paying 200 cpa, like 
we're paying a $400 cpa, right? It's like, guess who wins. We win, and 
not only that, but, like our conversion rate, will keep going up like 
I talked to a guy
610
01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:11.239
Copy Accelerator: he was gonna run some traffic through a kind 
boutique network with us, and he was like,
611
01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:18.049
Copy Accelerator: He's like we, you know. I really see like a it's 
like, if you could do like a $210 Cpa, and a 2% conversion rate.
612
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:23.319
Copy Accelerator: You know, we could literally do thousands of friends 
a day for you. Right, like all right, cool, because he's running for 
some other people.
613
01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:40.300
Copy Accelerator: And I'm like, right now our conversion rate. We can 
do a $210 Cpa, no problem, because we know our effective Cpas will be 
way lower, right? Based on like this data. Here, the problem would be 
our in our conversion rates 1.5 on average. So obviously, I want to 
get the conversion rate to 2. But if I can do that, and I can lower 
effective Cpa.
614
01:16:40.660 --> 01:17:07.979
Copy Accelerator: Even by sorry, even if I conversion rate, say to 

1.5. But I was able to pay a 300 or 400 cpa. Then to an affiliate or 
traffic buyer. They don't care. They don't actually care about the 
conversion rate. It's like, how much can I spend? It'd be better we 
could still get even more customers if I could acquire a ton of 
customers at, you know, a 2 conversion rate versus 1.5 conversion 
rate. But like, if I can give them extra $100 to play with for every 
customer they want to acquire, or an extra $200, they could still 
acquire way more customers. And so
615
01:17:08.220 --> 01:17:16.110
Copy Accelerator: and it's like we know what levers to pull. And so 
this is a long way to answer. But I'm really geeking out about this 
stuff. I really enjoyed it. And again, I think it's like really 
important for every
616
01:17:16.290 --> 01:17:30.112
Copy Accelerator: business that I'm going to build in the future, any 
like, you know, offer especially anything with physical products, 
especially. But frankly, again, the abandons like emails. SMS, that's 
for anything right? It doesn't have to just be physical. It's like 
info products books, whatever.
617
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:33.989
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I don't know. So that that's really it's like.
618
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.587
Copy Accelerator: just hyper focusing on on this metric, right? Like, 
is really
619
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.659
Copy Accelerator: has been the big thing, I think.
620
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.840
Mony Zarazua: And you have someone who enters all that information for 
you every day.
621
01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:54.510
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, so it was. You know, Angela is, you know. Co, 
she's a partner. She's awesome right? She came from a a big Pharma 
background where she was like, you know.
622
01:17:54.700 --> 01:18:02.189

Copy Accelerator: like a Vp level. I had her brought in to help with 
Luke. Mary and I were doing like AI agency stuff we kind of got away 
from doing.
623
01:18:02.617 --> 01:18:26.069
Copy Accelerator: You know, I'm not doing that much agency stuff right 
now, to be honest with you, because I'm like this is working. I'm 
enjoying pro, and then I'll probably do some other direct to consumer 
brands pretty soon here. But I basically you know she has 20 equity, 
and Ca, pro. She has less than that in this, because I didn't start 
it. The the CEO did but I got her a chunk, and I'm working on getting 
more for myself and for her. So anyway, she's a rock star, having. I 
finally have that like Integrator person. So I really feel like I'm 
just
624
01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:38.289
Copy Accelerator: like, do phenomenal things in the next few years, 
because I have that person who's like all the sops and set up this and 
then now we have like a like a Va guy she found on upwork, who's like 
good of excel and smart, and so he's the one going in and updating 
this every day. Now.
625
01:18:38.570 --> 01:18:39.390
Copy Accelerator: nurse.
626
01:18:39.700 --> 01:18:43.520
Mony Zarazua: Yeah, that makes sense to having that team in place 
also. Well.
627
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:46.999
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, super exciting. We're we're trying to build 
it, you know. Obviously.
628
01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:51.123
Copy Accelerator: we'll see what happens. But my, my intentionality is 
definitely
629
01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.979
Copy Accelerator: you know, trying to like, you know. Exit this for 
like
630
01:18:55.030 --> 01:19:06.295

Copy Accelerator: I really wanna ask it for like 200 plus 1 million 
dollars in like 12 to 18 months. Right. I have like 40% of that when 
we do it. And I have like 25. But like that, 40% really, really make 
it feel good
631
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:08.799
Copy Accelerator: and honestly feel like, you know, if if
632
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:16.700
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I think there's a i'm I've been around long 
enough that I'm not gonna say like we're gonna you know. Oh, 
absolutely, we'll do it. But I think.
633
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:27.089
Copy Accelerator: yeah, I think we have a decent chance based on our 
numbers. And again, the fact right now we're already so valuable 
because we're acquiring customers for so much less than our 
competitors are. So I think it's really valuable. And yeah, as we 
scale.
634
01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:28.160
Copy Accelerator: But yeah.
635
01:19:28.730 --> 01:19:32.869
Copy Accelerator: I know. I mean the chat 600 Rcp, you're seeing, for 
example, market.
636
01:19:32.970 --> 01:19:38.749
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, like it was that? Well, not just it was that 
big. But I mean like, and it's even some of glue ties and things like 
that cause there's so much money pouring into the market
637
01:19:38.810 --> 01:19:44.120
Copy Accelerator: that people are taking like, like, you know, G 
plans, which is now future health. I think they took
638
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:49.810
Copy Accelerator: 20 million, either 10 or 20 million, and like 
private equity money like maybe
639
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:55.509

Copy Accelerator: 6 months ago to essentially just scale more and and 
go negative more. So. Some people are taking like
640
01:19:55.710 --> 01:20:00.310
Copy Accelerator: big chunks of money to do that. But and our CEO to 
be on you. Honest kind of keeps
641
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:03.739
Copy Accelerator: bringing it up. But I'm like, I really don't want 
to, because if we can, just
642
01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:11.590
Copy Accelerator: we can beat them. That's also one of the things that 
motivates me, too. Right? I could go start like a random 8 figure D to 
C kind of supplement offer thing or whatever. But
643
01:20:12.250 --> 01:20:23.340
Copy Accelerator: I've done that a bunch of times. So it's not 
exciting. But it's exciting to me like, can we? Can we beat these guys 
about taking outside money? Can we beat them with like, just 
optimizing shit and being better marketers like that's exciting to me, 
right? So that's sort of like a big motivator for me, too.
644
01:20:25.290 --> 01:20:27.990
Armin Farah: Yeah, I feel that that's always exciting is beating the 
Vcs.
645
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.639
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, it's just like
646
01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:39.900
Copy Accelerator: it's like, yeah, even more competitors. And I think 
pricing pressure. I think pricing will go down. I think, like there's 
a future where maybe that people get their 1st month of some of glue 
tied, or whatever it is right, which is like the
647
01:20:40.210 --> 01:20:43.817
Copy Accelerator: you're not supposed to say it's in your marketing. 
But the generic version of ozembic right for
648
01:20:44.140 --> 01:21:05.189

Copy Accelerator: It's like, try it for a dollar for a month like it's 
free. It's like, you know, 50 like super low cost. It's be all about 
Ltv. And all that other shit. So even then I want to be built to where 
like that happens like perfect. And that'll actually just rec already 
a lot. People entering the market now are gonna not be here in 6 
months because they're not gonna be able to sustain the economics of 
it. And we are. But I also wanna build it to where like it could 
literally go to like
649
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:08.460
Copy Accelerator: you're giving it away for free, and we're still just 
crushing it because of the machine.
650
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.760
Armin Farah: Nice.
651
01:21:10.930 --> 01:21:11.899
Copy Accelerator: Yeah. Isn't that.
652
01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.209
Armin Farah: Talking, Cpa. I thought I thought I'd
653
01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:18.529
Armin Farah: just ask cause we're about to launch this new offer. I'm 
wondering if you or anybody else
654
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:19.860
Armin Farah: on the call
655
01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:22.529
Armin Farah: can comment on like typical
656
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:24.370
Armin Farah: skincare.
657
01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:26.420
Armin Farah: Cpa.
658
01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:36.677
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, you could. I mean, you could reach out to 

Jason cause he's doing over. I don't know if I should say a number. 
He's doing a lot of sales per day for his friend Sneaker company.
659
01:21:37.340 --> 01:21:42.732
Copy Accelerator: so you I think you've asked him you would give you a 
good range, and I put the email on the was that I can always send it 
to you as well.
660
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:44.090
Armin Farah: I saw that.
661
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:50.689
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, I'd email him, I'm sure I'll answer. I I mean, 
I would guess you know, varies fluctuates while they've Meta. Yada. 
Yada, but I would guess there's somewhere like that
662
01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.050
Copy Accelerator: somewhere between a hundred $200, you know. On 
average, I would guess.
663
01:21:56.480 --> 01:22:01.559
Copy Accelerator: That's a big range. So maybe you put it like 1 50 
average. It would be my guess. But I'd actually be curious to hear 
what he says, too.
664
01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.654
Armin Farah: Or, okay. Thanks.
665
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.780
Mony Zarazua: Thank you so much, Stefan. That was great.
666
01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:10.049
Copy Accelerator: Yeah, my pleasure.
667
01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:12.670
Copy Accelerator: Anyone else got any questions before we wrap up
668
01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:21.709
Copy Accelerator: alright. Well, if not, I appreciate everyone as 
always. We'll keep going with more Vsl stuff next week.

669
01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:22.460
Copy Accelerator: and
670
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.730
Copy Accelerator: just you know. Thanks. I'll be around in the 
Whatsapp groups, and
671
01:22:26.770 --> 01:22:29.289
Copy Accelerator: we will talk soon, so thank everybody, appreciate 
it.
672
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.079
Leonidas Ntousias: And you, Stephan.
673
01:22:32.310 --> 01:22:32.970
Copy Accelerator: Thank you.

Unique Mechanism 
(RMBC) 
  
 Explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve 
 Problem/solution lead 
 ‘What’s missing’? Why fail in past? Why succeed in future? 
 Unique solution 
 Logically connected 
 Find one major, throbbing pain point and try to fix it 
 
I. In a Nutshell: 
  
The unique mechanism explains why our prospect is struggling or suffering to achieve a goal… 
  
And how they can overcome that problem. 
  
At its core, the unique mechanism is always a two-part logical connection. 
   
II. There are two parts to the unique mechanism: 
  
1. Unique Mechanism Behind the Problem our Prospect Faces. 
  
2. Unique Mechanism Behind the Solution to that Problem. 
  
It’s important to identify the unique mechanism behind both the problem AND the solution. 
  
By showing the unique mechanism behind the problem, you get the prospect to understand why 
they’ve failed in the past. 
  
By showing the unique mechanism behind the solution, you get the prospect to believe that our 
product will bring them success where other alternatives have failed. 
  
III. To Put It Another way… 
  
Typically by the time our prospect comes to us, they’ve tried numerous solutions to their 
problem already. In the past, these other solutions may have not worked at all, worked 
partially, or worked fully for a period of time (before they stopped working). 
  
Our job as a copywriter is to educate our prospect about the REAL reason why past solutions 
didn’t bring them permanent results. We do this by explaining that their knowledge about the 
problem is incomplete. They’ve been missing ONE CRUCIAL PIECE OF INFORMATION, and this 
“knowledge gap” is what’s been holding them back.
