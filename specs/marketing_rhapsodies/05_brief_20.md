Brief



1. Who’s the Audience?







2. What are the pain points, or biggest fears?

(+ identify the 1-3 HUGE ones, while the rest are secondary)



- Short Term:





-Long Term:





3. So by reversing the pain points/biggest fears, what is the one big promise (1-3 sentences) you are going to make about the sales copy they’re now reading…how this will change their lives forever?





4. What solutions for the reader’s problem (s) exist already (and why aren’t they working for them)?









5. What’s the new claim/root cause/surprising info? And how does this new solution we’re offering them work? [This is the Unique Mechanism Part]



(Think about it as if they had 99% of the solution already, but you’re sharing that missing 1%...the easy but unexpected REAL REASON, or REAL SECRET to their success).











6. Paradoxical Question:







7. Metaphor:











8. Bold Claim 

(What’s the huge promise about the results they’re going to get using this product/solution?):









9. What is the Product? 

(If you can write out fascinations here, it will help you immensely. This is the part where you get to shape exactly what the product we’re selling will include)











10. Background Story + Story of Discovery: 









11. Some Headline Ideas: 

(One sentence – something that would be the first line of the VSL, or in the copy above the video screen. Attention grabbing)









12. Ideas for a potential upsell product?

(Something that could be sold to the customer immediately after purchasing the main product. You’d want this to be related to product, but solve an additional problem, or provide a significant additional benefit).

Brief



1. Who’s the Audience?







2. What are the pain points, or biggest fears?

(+ identify the 1-3 HUGE ones, while the rest are secondary)



- Short Term:





-Long Term:





3. So by reversing the pain points/biggest fears, what are the big promises you are going to make about the sales copy they’re watching…how this will change their lives forever?
(These are promises about what they will get from interacting with the sales copy, or for teasing a solution you’ll be showing them in the sales copy).



4. What Does It Look Like When A Prospect’s Pain Points Have Been Solved? 

This can include physical, emotional, social and psychological benefits. 





5. What solutions for the reader’s problem (s) exist already (and why aren’t they working for them)?



6. What is the Unique Mechanism of the Problem and the Unique Mechanism of the Solution? 

Please include enough detail so that when given to an LLM, it could write this whole section without struggling.















7. Is There A Unique Nickname for the Unique Mechanism?
This is something that would be teased early on in the lead of the VSL. For example the “7 second bowel releasing ritual” or the “30 second breakfast hack” or “Paper Flipping” to tease a real estate arbitrage method. 



8. (Optional, For Supplements): What are the main ingredients in the formulation. 

For each main ingredient, include 2-3 studies showing their efficacy. 





9. Bold Product Claims

(What’s the huge promise or promises about the results they’re going to get using this product/solution? Note, this is different than the promises from #3. These are now specific promises and claims about how their life will change for the better once they buy the product):









10. What is the Product? 

(This is where we’ll include product details. This might include features and benefits for physical products and programs. It might include fascinations or curiosity bullet teasers for informational programs. The more detail here the better). 











11. Background Story + Story of Discovery: 

This is often a hero's journey structure. The spokesperson or someone the spokesperson knows was in pain. The spokesperson ends up on a quest to find an answer to their pain point. They end up discovering the unique mechanism, why existing solutions don’t work, etc. 





12. Who is the main speaker in the VSL? 

Include a quick snapshot of who they are and their credibility.

13. Is there a second speaker or “expert’ who also has a large role in the VSL?


14. Does the spokesperson partner with a brand or company once they’ve discovered the product? 

If so, please share information about the brand or company here.



15. List of Testimonials or Social Proof If Available



16. Include any Credibility Builders that can be used in the opening of the sales copy. 

This could reference studies about the ingredients, or about the UMP, etc. Perhaps Harvard scientists uncovered the real cause of your problem. Maybe Tony Robbins endorsed this solution? Maybe the program has been featured in Forbes or Good Morning America. Etc.





17. What Is The Normal Retail Price For The Product Being Sold?

18. What Is The Actual Price People Who Watch the VSL Will Pay?

19. If the VSL sells a product with multiple options, what are those options and what is the pricing for each option?

20. What Is The Guarantee?

21. Are There Any Bonuses?

If so please list them out. 





22. Please List Out Any Other Scarcity Elements If There Are Any. 



23. Please Write Out Specific Future-Paced Results and Benefits People Could Expect To Experience After Using the Product.



24. What Are Common Objections Prospects Might Have When Watching the VSL, and How Can We Answer Them?



25. Are there any specific Hooks or Big Ideas that you think should be tested in the lead of the VSL?

Your Job is to Create New Briefs for Copywriting Projects. These are things that I can give to Claude Projects or other LLMs to have them write copy. We’ll mostly be focused on VSLs here, but I may end up asking you to create a brief for an eCommerce page in the future as well.



I’ve included two documents in your knowledge base for now. 



The first is an in-depth brief. It is titled “The New Brief.” 



The second is an outline of the classic Video Sales Letter Structure I’ve used for a long time. That one is mostly for reference. 



Here’s how this will work: 



I will use your chat feature to provide documents that can assist you in writing the brief for a specific product. You’ll then do that. For anything where you don’t have information, you can use placeholders to start.
